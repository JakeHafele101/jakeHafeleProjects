                My Life so Far
            </div>
            <div class="contentMain">
                To start, I am a 19 year old college student who is now between thier first and second year of college. 
                I enjoy building computers, scuba diving, and of course, writing code. I have had almost 10 different saint
                bernards at different times growing up, so pets have also been a big part of my life growing up. I have grown 
                up in the same small town in Illinois for most of my life, but now go to college at Iowa State University.
                I am a huge fan of the larger college as it has helped me meet a lot of new people and gain new opportunities. <br> <br>

                My Time at College
            </div>
            <div class="contentMain">
                Currently, I am working on getting a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering at Iowa State university. I
                decided on this major spur of the moment last Summer around July. I was planning on doing Electrical Engineering,
                which is pretty similar, but I decided I wanted to focus on coding a little more. After finishing my first
                year of college, I can say I am very happy to have made this choice. I mainly have an interest in coding 
                related to hardware topics, but many different software areas have piqued my interest lately. I plan on 
                trying out a bunch of different areas to find out what I like the most, to try and help me find what kind
                of job I want after college. Right now, I am very interested in pursuing embedded systems. <br> <br>

                Clubs at College
            </div>
            <div class="contentMain">
                One of the biggest groups I got involved in last year during college was the Iowa State marching band. Last 
                year, I was apart of Storm, the junior varsity group in our marching band. This meant that I got the chance
                to play during football, soccer, and wrestling events at our school. This led to me being able to meet tons
                of new people and get adjusted to college faster than I expected. I also joined a club, Critical Tinkers, 
                which helps fund and support peoples coding projects throughout the school year. This club has helped to 
                enable me to make all sorts of things without having to worry about the cost and expenses of parts, since
                they cover those fees.
