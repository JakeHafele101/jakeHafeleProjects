            <div class="contentMain">
                The main goal of this project was to create a robot arm that would respond to my movements when wearing a glove. The
                input from the glove would be gathered from two different sensors. These sensors would be a flex sensor and a motion 
                sensor, or the MPU6050. The robot arm would be controlled by micro servos at four different joints. I will end up having
                to solder wires together so the glove has enough room to move around from the arduino. I will need two seperate power 
                supplies so the servos and arduino do not damage each other. The ground wires will still need to be connected through the
                two power supplies though.

                Process

            <div class="contentMain">
                One of the first goals of this project was to design the different parts of the robot arm. I did this in CAD software
                and then printed it out on my 3D printer. This section probably took the most time out of the project overall. This is
                because I had to test and design ways to mount the servos effictively to the arm for joints. I started with designing 
                the base for the first servo, which was a large cylinder. The piece that attached to the first servo was a thin disk that
                screwed into the servo. This would rotate 90 degrees to the left and right to simulate the arm turning left and right. 
                The next 3 servos acted as arm joints near the top of the arm. These would handle the arm for moving up and down. These 
                joints were mounted sideways and were very similar. The final servo was attached to a gear and clamp. Another gear was 
                made to mirror the servo gear so that when the servo would move back or forth, the opposite gear would follow suit. I 
                was really happy with how this turned out and it makes me want to try more gear prints in the future. By this point I had
                to wait for these seperate parts to print, where I know started testing the servos and sensors. <br><br>

                For this project, I made a few test programs before putting together the final code. I made one program which tested 
                just the flex sensor, which only used one analog pin. The code for this was very simple, and the wiring wasn't too 
                complicated either. After this, I wrote a program to test the servo library and make sure my servos would work properly.
                To do this, you have to define a digital pin for the servo and make a servo object. Then, you have to use the servo object
                you made and call the function write() to it to tell it how far over to rotate. You can use any value between 0 and 180 
                since it is defined in degrees. This program helped me immensely for making sure my servos worked and for when I had to 
                actually put together the build. Finally, I wrote a program to get input from both the flex sensor and the motion sensor.
                I used a MPU6050 library online to help me get the best data from the motion sensor. After I used this code, I put in the
                flex sensor code from my other program in it. After this worked, I wrote my final program to place in the conditional 
                checks for the flex and motion sensors. These would check the values of my input sensors to see if and where the servos
                should move. By this point, I was ready to put everything together. <br><br>

                I had some trouble with putting together the pieces with the holes for the servos to go in. Mounting the servos in to the
                seperate parts was not a problem though. So, to fix this, I ended up putting on the plastic arms that come with the servos
                on the servos and then hot glueing the parts together. I didn't fully like this solution, since it makes it harder to take
                the arm apart for the future. Although, if I didn't do this, I would have had to fully reprint many of the parts and it 
                would have probably not been worth the effort. The code actually ended up working really smoothly on the first runs. I 
                started the final code by testing one servo joint at a time. I did this so I could make sure each one was working correctly
                and so they wouldn't all break at once and damage the robot arm. At this point the project was pretty much done and now 
                I had an extra robot hand to help me do whatever I needed. <br><br>

                This project helped motivate me to get better at CAD design and it really helped spark my interest in robotics and 
                prosthetics. I hope I can keep getting better with using servos and motors in the future so I can keep doing things like
                this. At some point I hope to recreate a human arm but I would probably need stronger motors for that. I plan for my
                next project to use similar micro servos but I hope I can design and plan them better so that I do not need to worry as
                much about the stability of the project. I can't wait to do more stuff like this because the feedback on the input to 
                output is very satisfying to create. Thanks for reading about my fun robot project and if you are still interested there
                are videos down below where I talk about them more. Thank you for reading!
