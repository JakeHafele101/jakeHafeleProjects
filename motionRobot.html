                    My Goals
                </Header>

                <General>
                    For this project I designed a robot arm that mirrored the movements of my hand while wearing a
                    glove. I wanted to gain a better understanding of using multiple analog inputs to control servos,
                    and I thought an application of a robot arm would be interesting, combined with my 3D printing
                    skills. These sensors would include a flex (resistive band) and motion sensor (MPU6050). The robot
                    arm would be controlled by servos at four different joints, to mimic the movements of a real arm. A
                    glove with both the flex and motion sensor were made to control the robot, with wires attached to
                    them with enough length to allow full range of motion.

                    The Process
                </Header>

                <General>
                    One of the first steps of this project was to design the different parts of the robot arm. I did
                    this in Autodesk Fusion 360, and then printed it out on my 3D printer. This section took the most
                    time out of the project overall, due to needing to test and design effective ways to mount the
                    servos to the joints. I started with designing the base for the first servo, which was a large
                    cylinder. The piece that attached to the first servo was a thin disk that screwed into the servo.
                    This would rotate 90 degrees to the left and right to simulate the arm turning left and right
                    respectively. The next 3 servos acted as arm joints near the top of the arm, allowing the arm to
                    move both up and down vertically. These joints were mounted sideways and were very similar in design
                    and implementation. The final servo was attached to a gear and clamp, to allow the arm to grab
                    objects that were light enough. Another gear was made to mirror the servo gear so that when the
                    servo would move back or forth, the opposite gear would follow suit and clamp the object. I was very
                    happy with how this turned out, and it made me want to try more gear prints in the future. <br><br>

                    &#8195;
                    For this project, I made a few test programs before putting together the final code. I designed one
                    program which tested the flex sensor, which only used one analog pin. The idea in testing the
                    individual sensors on their own was so that it would be easier to understand what kinds of data
                    would come out, depending on different states. For example, I wanted to know what analog values I
                    could get from both bending and keeping the resistive flex sensor straight. Next, I wrote a program
                    to test the servo library and ensure my servos would work properly. To do this, I had to define a
                    digital pin for the servo and instantiate a servo object. Then, I used the servo object and called
                    the function write() to tell it how far to rotate. I could use any value between 0 and 180, since it
                    is defined in degrees. This program helped me immensely for making sure my servos worked and for
                    when I had to put together the entire build. Finally, I wrote a program to get the inputs from both
                    the flex and motion sensor. I used a MPU6050 library to assist me in obtaining the best data from
                    the motion sensor. After I used this code, I put in the flex sensor code from my other program in
                    it. After this, I wrote my final program to place in the conditional checks for the flex and motion
                    sensors. These would check the values of my input sensors to see if and where the servos should
                    move. This project was interesting since I had to dynamically turn the servos based on a ratio of
                    the analog values I was receiving, which was unique from my previous digital project where I was
                    processing the sound LED’s as either on or off. <br><br>

                    
                    &#8195;
                    Finally, I was able to assemble the 3D printed parts and individual electronic components I had
                    tested into one full piece. I had some trouble assembling the pieces with the holes for the servos
                    to go in that I 3D printed. So, to fix this, I ended up putting the plastic teeth that come with the
                    servos and then hot gluing the parts together. I didn't enjoy this solution, since it made it more
                    difficult to take the arm apart in the future. I ended up investigating a better way to implement
                    the servo attachments, which can be seen in the “useless” machine that I created in my Sophomore
                    year of school. The code ended up working very smoothly on the first few runs. I started the final
                    code by testing one servo joint at a time. I did this so I could make sure each individual servo was
                    working correctly, and so that they wouldn't all break at once and damage the arm. At this point the
                    project was pretty much done and now I had an extra robot hand to help me do whatever I needed!

                <General>
                    This project helped motivate me to develop stronger CAD design skills, and it really helped to spark
                    my interest in robotics. I hope to keep improving my skills to interface servos and motors so I can
                    keep expanding on similar projects. My next project used similar micro servos in a similar fashion
                    to recreate the movement of a spider, except with four legs. That project also does a great job of
                    showcasing and expanding what I have learned about 3D design, embedded programming, and problem
                    solving skills. Thanks for reading my work!
