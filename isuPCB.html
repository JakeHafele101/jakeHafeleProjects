                    Goals
                </Header>

                <General>
                    The main goal of this project was to create a PCB that would light up an Iowa State University “I”
                    with LEDs. I wanted to also design a box casing and glass cover over the circuit board, to protect
                    the hardware and soldering. Since I was using a PCB, I wanted to try and design a circuit without
                    using an Arduino microcontroller and instead apply some of what I learned through my digital logic
                    class that I took in the Fall semester. To do this, I would use an oscillator to act as a clock and
                    a counter to activate the transistors that would light up the yellow LEDs in a given order based on
                    the clock. I also would like to further learn how to use Altium Designer, which is the PCB design
                    software I used to design my board.

                    Process
                </Header>

                <General>
                    In general, this is a PCB that I personally designed and soldered that used a counter and a clock to
                    make different LED’s flash to show off an Iowa State logo. The red LEDs are always on, and by using
                    transistors and yellow LEDs I made it so they would turn on and off around the red lights. Through
                    my digital logic class that I took in the fall, I learned how to use a counter and apply it to these
                    transistors. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    The first thing I started with was designing the schematic in Altium, a PCB design software, and
                    prototyping the circuit on a breadboard with Arduino. This helped me feel much more confident using
                    transistors. I used NPN transistors that when turned on, would connect the ground line of the yellow
                    LEDs so a closed circuit would be made with their resistor and 5V plane. Each number on a modulo ten
                    counter was connected to one of these transistors, so when the clock went from low to high, the next
                    transistor would turn on and the previous one would turn off. I tried to apply more low-level logic
                    and do more stuff by hand this time around, unlike my previous projects where Arduino lent a hand in
                    many spots. I found an oscillator online and an equation to help delay the timing of the pulse, so
                    the oscillator didn’t pulse too fast. This led me to a circuit that used two capacitors and a
                    resistor to delay the pulse. Overall, I am happy with how the timing of the clock turned out. The
                    wiring of the counter was very straightforward, I just had to pay close attention to the datasheet
                    for which of the other pins to keep high and low so the counter would act as normal. I also used a
                    dc barrel jack and a fuse to get 5V of power from a DC wall converter. I then wired a switch to the
                    barrel jack so you could turn the board on and off without unplugging it. This was super easy to do
                    and way more accessible doing it on a PCB than a breadboard. With that done, the schematic was
                    mostly finished, so I moved on to designing the final PCB. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    I wanted the physical board to be compact, but easy to solder. Since I had so many parts to solder
                    because of the LEDs, and since I was still mostly new to surface mount soldering, I didn’t want
                    pieces to be so close that I couldn’t undo a mistake or two. I constantly checked the distance
                    between the closest parts to make sure it was possible throughout the layout phase, which benefitted
                    me greatly in the long run. I used the alignment tools in Altium to make sure the LEDs were all in
                    proper rows and columns, and the board turned out really well because of this. Without this tool,
                    this project wouldn’t have been possible. I put the counter and clock to the right side of the
                    board, near the barrel jack and switch, since these were the first parts that would go through my
                    circuit. This worked very well with my final 3D design and I am happy I kept these parts together. I
                    poured a 5v plane on the top layer and a ground plane on the bottom. If I ever needed to connect
                    ground to anything, I would just use a small hole, or a via, to route it through to the bottom layer
                    and connect it to ground. <br> <br>

                    After the PCB was finished, I waited for the parts to ship and started on the 3D printing design. I
                    used two separate parts and some plexiglass to act as a screen for the LEDs. The bottom box had
                    screw holes to mount the PCB to the box so it was sturdy, and a part to hang it on a wall if wanted.
                    I used a smaller piece with screw holes that would hold the plexiglass in place after I scored and
                    fitted it for the parts. The prints themselves were straightforward after a few test prints to make
                    sure the dimensions of the PCB were good. At this point, I feel like I am getting more confident
                    with the CAD design and using my ender 3 printer. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    After the prints were done, all that was left was to solder the actual board. After putting on all
                    the parts, I used a multimeter to test the counter and clock. Around the edges of the board, I
                    placed test joints which would tell me when different parts of the counter were on or off. This was
                    useful because it helped me learn if my circuit would have an issue with power, the counter, or
                    parts that were not soldered on correctly the first time. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    Overall, I was happy with how bright the LEDs were and how it turned out. This project was partly
                    inspired by those neon lights that people put in their basements or bars of sports teams. Using a
                    PCB was very helpful to this project and I am going to keep applying it to my future projects, since
                    it is much sturdier than breadboards.

                <General>
                    Overall, I learned a lot from this project. It helped to reinforce a lot of what I learned through
                    clubs and classes at Iowa state from the Fall, including PCB design and some basics in digital
                    design. So, this was a fantastic project to wrap up what I learned in my Fall 2020 semester of
                    school. I will definitely be using more PCB's that I design in future projects alongside Arduino and
                    my usual 3D printing.
