                    Goals
                </Header>

                <General>
                    Headnode is one of two different custom PCBs in solar car that are a part of our Battery Protection
                    System (BPS). The first board, Moduleboard, monitors the status of one battery module, which
                    includes 34 18650GA Lithium-Ion batteries in parallel. Our entire battery pack includes 35 of these
                    battery modules in series to reach a nominal voltage of 140 V, and in turn 35 Moduleboards, each
                    going on the top of a battery module. The second board, Headnode, controls the battery pack relays
                    by checking if either the hardware or software faults on either board are asserted. Both the
                    hardware checks made by comparators and the software checks made against a voltage reference need to
                    not be triggered on a Moduleboard. The hardware fault is ANDed together with the logic check from
                    the next board, so when one module faults in the middle of the board, the proceeding Moduleboard
                    will also fault in a ripple carry. The initial 5V "Working" signal for the fault is initially
                    supplied by Headnode, and sent to Moduleboard #1. At the last Moduleboard, #35, this ANDed logic
                    signal will be sent back in to Headnode as an input. The software checks are made over an isolated
                    CAN network that is connected only to the boards inside the battery pack. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    In General, the purpose of BPS is to monitor these faults and control the battery pack relays that
                    open/close to control battery consumption. Both BPS and Powerboard, a board used to regulate the
                    battery pack voltage down to 12 V, are powered off of a 25 V supplemental battery used to check the
                    state of the batteries before drawing current from them. This is needed as a safety precaution and
                    because of regulations we have to follow to build the car. With this supplemental battery, BPS will
                    check to see if any hardware and software faults trigger in the car, and if they don't, BPS will
                    close the positive, negative, and charge relays in the battery pack. After this is done, Headnode
                    will send a buffered 12V logic signal to powerboard indicating that it is now okay to draw current
                    from the battery pack through the closed relays. Powerboard will simultaneously switch off of
                    drawing power from the supplemental battery pack to our main battery pack. After this, the fourth
                    and final board in the battery pack, Precharge, is powered and can start to slowly increase the
                    voltage given to the motors through a power resistor. Since we use DC series motors, if we instantly
                    give it 140 V through a closed relay, we would blow them up. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    Generally, this lays out how our newly revised battery pack architecture works. Before this revision
                    of Headnode, Precharge was used to drive 12 V through the positive and negative relays that connect
                    to the battery pack terminals. So, the primary goal of this rev was to maintain the same
                    requirements for turning on the car and moving relay logic from Precharge to Headnode.

                    Design
                </Header>

                <General>

                    Since in the goals tab I talked about the top level overview of the architecture for our battery
                    pack, I would like to talk about the different changes to the schematic and PCB layout that I helped
                    accomplish for this rev of Headnode here. On this revision, since there were 8 different schematic
                    pages, we used input and output ports to manage the different signals and power lines. So, we had a
                    master page that showed how the interconnections worked between the pages. This was very helpful
                    since Altium would highlight when a specific port was either not connected or labeled as an input or
                    output wrong. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    On the connector page, we listed the 12V power circuit, which at this time was not the same as
                    Buttonboard or HAL. We did not update this circuit for this change, but it should be noted that I
                    did update the power circuit to be the same in the following revision. This page also has ports
                    tying to all of the connectors on the board, including logic signals for faults or enable signals
                    for different boards. This page also included the 12 V control lines for the three different battery
                    pack relays, positive, negative, and charge that are driven by Headnode as of this revision. There
                    are also two CAN connectors for our CAN bus and a connector used for logic to turn on the solar cell
                    array and external charger. The charging connector is a redundancy and we noted to remove many of
                    these logic signals in the next rev since they were not used and would lead to confusion during
                    system implementation. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    On the next schematic page, the interface logic, we handled multiple AND gates, an inverter, and
                    MOSFET buffers to manage different logic signals going to Powerboard and Precharge, and coming in
                    from Moduleboard. The logic signal START_EN was used to monitor any fault conditions that could
                    happen externally from Headnode. Three logic signals were AND'ed together, including external kill,
                    a software fault from a Moduleboard, and a hardware fault from a Moduleboard. External kill is a
                    switch that we are required to have by regulation on the outside of the car that will open the
                    relays connected to the battery pack. Each individual relay now also is AND'ed with a relay control
                    signal from the microcontroller on Headnode and the given START_EN logic. The other AND gates are
                    used to create an XOR gate to enable externally charging or our solar array. As mentioned before,
                    many of these logic signals related to charging went unused, so much of this got removed later on.
                    The powerboard buffer circuit is very similar to what is used now on HAL, as mentioned before.
                    Generally, a PMOS and an NMOS are used to buffer a 5V enable signal from a microcontroller to create
                    a 12V source that is outputted from Headnode to Powerboard that is not being drawn directly from the
                    microcontroller. Precharge used a 5V enable pin and a BJT, which was later changed due to our team
                    not using many BJT's, which affected part availability. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    The Moduleboard interface schematic is pretty empty, but it also makes it very easy to follow. On
                    the top portion, a NPN transistor is used for the Moduleboard hardware fault return line, which will
                    buffer a 5V signal to determine if there is a hardware fault on any module. If the fault return line
                    is 5V, or logic "high", then there is no fault, but if it is 0V, or logic level "low", then we have
                    faulted. We decided to do it this way so that it would be easier to AND this signal for START_EN on
                    the previous page. The external kill line is connected to a latching button on the outside of the
                    car, with the other end being ground. There is a pull up resistor to 5V on the external switch line
                    on Headnode, so that when the button is not latched, we will not fault the car and disconnect the
                    batteries. When the button is pressed, current will flow through ground since it is the path of
                    least resistance, and the car will fault since this logic is used for START_EN. There is also a
                    0-ohm jumper resistor that is used connected between 5V and the analog fault output that starts the
                    hardware checks at Moduleboard #1. this jumper was included for testing and is always connected,
                    which was later removed due to redundancies in a later revision. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    The compute page is used to show input and output port connections to the microcontroller. Some
                    notable inputs include the external charge switch and hardware Moduleboard fault logic for
                    monitoring. Some essential outputs include the relay enable logic that is AND'ed with the START_EN
                    logic to close the relays, and the logic that is buffered to send a signal to the other battery pack
                    boards Powerboard and Precharge. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    The regulators page is used to generate a 5V power line and a 2.5V reference. The 5V regulator is
                    very important as it powers our microcontroller and is used for multiple logic gates on the board.
                    The 2.5V reference is a redundancy from our previous architecture and will be removed on later
                    revisions. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    The core of the board is within the next two schematic pages, which are used to power the relays
                    that will supply a 12V output from Headnode to the battery pack relays. So, in general, we use
                    relays to power more relays. Like I mentioned before, 2 input AND gates are used with START_EN and a
                    software logic signal to turn on each individual relay. The positive, negative, and charge relays
                    are all separated by 200 milliseconds of turn on in the car, which leads to a very satisfying sound
                    when we turn the car fully on. We included 0-ohm resistors so that we could choose between using the
                    relays to supply 12V or instead a power switch part that we were testing with this revision. Due to
                    the semiconductor shortage, we were unable to test or implement the power switches, but those will
                    make a return in revision 2 of Headnode. The relay page uses a similar NMOS/PMOS buffer with a 5V
                    logic signal to suppler 12V to the relays on Headnode. We also used flyback diodes across the
                    inductors of the relays to ensure no relay would accidentally close when undesired, which would
                    accidentally turn the battery pack on! <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    Since we added so many parts to this version of Headnode, we decided to completely redo the PCB
                    layout. In general, the left side of the board is used for the MOSFET buffers and relays that are
                    used to supply the 12 V output to drive the battery pack relays. The right side of the board is used
                    to manage logic gates relating to charging, and it also includes the input for the external kill
                    switch. The top of the board includes connectors to power battery pack fans, current sensors for our
                    pack, and the logic signal that is sent to Precharge. On the bottom of the board, we included the
                    buffer circuit that creates a 12 V logic signal for Powerboard. The microcontroller is included in
                    the middle of the board so that it can be easily reached between every circuit on the respective
                    sides of the board. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    We decided to make the new version of the board 4 layers, so that it would be easier to manage the
                    12V, 5V, and ground layers. On the top and bottom layers, we made the left side of the board 12V and
                    the right side of the board ground. We then used stitching vias to connect the top and bottom layers
                    so that we would not have to worry about islands on our power planes. This board is also where I was
                    taught how to manage signals on different layers. In general, we tried to keep vertical traces on
                    the bottom plane in blue, and horizontal signals on the top plane in red.

                    What I Learned
                </Header>

                <General>
                    Overall, I would say this project is where I took a deep dive in to solar car. After learning how to
                    do the general PCB design process with the team on Buttonboard, I moved to designing Headnode during
                    the Spring of 2021. During this time, I got to learn more about designing circuits and layout for
                    logic gates and diodes, while also learning more about the upcoming changes to our battery pack
                    architecture. This opened tons of great opportunities for me, since I was then able to actively
                    participate in more debugging sessions before our Summer 2021 FSGP race.
