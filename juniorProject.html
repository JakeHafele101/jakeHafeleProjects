                <General>
                    During my time on working on the Horn and Lights Project, HAL, I was able to manage and help guide
                    new members in designing one of our application boards for Solar Car. HAL's focus is to take in data
                    over our software's CAN network to turn on different lights and the horn in the car. If you have
                    seen my writeup or video on buttonboard, you will notice that this is the direct inverse to that
                    board, where this time we are receiving CAN packets and converting them to a voltage output on this
                    board. Since the first revision of this board was already created in the previous year, it was our
                    job to improve on where it had failed before. Specifically, we had issues with some parts being
                    underspecced in how much current they should be capable of handling. Also, some of the traces on the
                    PCB were not well equipped to handle current outputs over 5A. To fix this, we made our goal in
                    redesigning the board to spec out larger parts, create wider PCB traces, and expand the board to 4
                    layers to make signal management cleaner.

                    During this revision of Headnode, I was actively working as the BPS hardware manager. After the last
                    revision and summer testing, I decided that this revision would be used to clean up old redundancies
                    and unused parts of the last board, while standardizing circuits to match our other boards. Some
                    changes include updating our 12V power circuit, removing unused charging logic, updating the MOSFET
                    buffers to the other battery pack boards, removing unused Moduleboard circuits, and updating the
                    circuit that drives the battery pack relays to the new power switch part, instead of the old relays.
                    The goal was to maintain meeting all the regulations of the old board while adding quality of life
                    improvements that would help future development of Headnode. <br> <br>

                <General>
                    On the following page, I cover the second year of my time in Solar Car. This includes managing
                    hardware projects, going on my first solar car race, and being on the electrical leadership team.
                    During my second year, I helped manage and lead two different electrical projects, including
                    Headnode, which helps monitor our battery protection system, and HAL, which controls the horn and
                    lights in the car. I also participated in the FSGP and ASC 2021 Solar Car race as a driver! If you
                    want to see some video of me driving the car, this is the place to be. Finally, I worked on creating
                    a standardized part library for all of our current and new hardware projects to use, to help
                    condense the amount of parts used to save time and money from Digikey orders. <br> <br>
