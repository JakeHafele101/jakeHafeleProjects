                The goal of this project was to make the most faithful recreation of an old style tetris game. I 
                specifically wanted to use class inheritance to reinforce what I learned in my java coding class at school. 
                To do this, I planned on making a general class for the blocks and a specific one for each block. I wanted
                the controls to be done through keyboard input by the player. I also wanted a start, pause, and game over
                screen to make the game more accessible for the user. To be more faithful towards tetris, a score, level, 
                and lines cleared tabs will be needed on the sides of the main grid. The game will also display a next block
                feature and a held block feature. These will be used to give the player some help with the game. 
                finally, I wished to make the resolution a moderate to small size so the game could be more accessible. 
                This project will be done in Processing, which is a Java tool that helps to make drawing shapes and 
                objects much easier. Currently, this is my go to application for making simple games.

                The goal of the last two week for me has been to create a 4 x 4 x 4 LED cube. For this project, my main goal was to get 
                more familiar with soldering electronic parts to be used with arduino boards.I had never soldered before so I figured 
                that this would be the most challenging part of this build for me. I would have to solder together every LED, resistor, 
                and wire all to connect back to the arduino board to send different signals for the pattern. To do this, I would need to
                create a template to create one layer of the cube. After all the layers would be built, I would have to solder them 
                together and wire it up to a board to make a more permanent and final structure. At every point, I would need to check
                to make sure each LED could light up after soldering the layers together with 5 volt and ground pins. After that, wires
                and resistors would be added to the board and the arduino uno would be placed on the permanent. After that, I could use 
                some test code I found online to test my cube and then create my own fun patterns.

                The main goal of this project was to get more comfortable with using LED strips and an input sensor to change the strips.
                I ended up using a sound sensor for my input, since I could have the LED strips respond and light up to the sounds. I 
                also wanted to use my new 3D printer to design and print off the structure to support all of the electronics. I will
                solder and connect the wires with a breadboard and arduino uno. I also wanted to make the design of the box practical
                enough to make the project easier on me.

                The main goal of this project was to create a robot arm that would respond to my movements when wearing a glove. The
                input from the glove would be gathered from two different sensors. These sensors would be a flex sensor and a motion 
                sensor, or the MPU6050. The robot arm would be controlled by micro servos at four different joints. I will end up having
                to solder wires together so the glove has enough room to move around from the arduino. I will need two seperate power 
                supplies so the servos and arduino do not damage each other. The ground wires will still need to be connected through the
                two power supplies though.

                The main goal of this project was to create a robot that would act like a spider. This would be done by creating 
                different parts of legs to connect to servos, that would act as joints. I would also need to design a base that could
                connect the four seperate legs and hold the arduino and other electronics. I would use a servo driver to control the 
                seperate legs with arduino code and a servo driver library. I will also design a controller that will be used with
                wireless receivers between the controller and spider. Two seperate power supplies will be needed on the spider to power
                the arduino nano and the servos seperately. I planned on making the spider be able to move forwards and backwards, while
                also being able to turn left and right. I also added more buttons on the controller to make the spider be able to do
                other fun actions.
