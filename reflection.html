                <General>
                    During my time at Iowa State University, I have gained an immeasurable amount of skills, involving
                    how to learn, design, and teach in the engineering field. Between all of my classes, projects,
                    clubs, and jobs, I believe that I have gained many skills through my 4 years as a student at Iowa
                    State studying Electrical Engineering. There have been countless professors, friends, and
                    organizations that have helped further my skills, and I am happy to keep giving back to the
                    community on campus through staying involved in clubs, classes, and activities.
                    The largest part of my time spent at Iowa State University was in different classes as an Electrical
                    Engineer. During these classes, I would make an effort to try and go to at least one professor’s
                    office hours every week and focus on getting a good grade in that class, which was normally the most
                    difficult one for me at a given semester. Some classes where I took a personal responsibility like
                    this included Calculus 2, Signals and Systems 1, and Computer Organization and Assembly Level
                    Programming. I have seen a great return on both the understanding of the material, and also in
                    developing a strong relationship with my professors that work with me on a weekly basis. I am also
                    satisfied with how I have expanded on the material that I have learned in classes, towards creating
                    my own individual projects. For example, after taking my Digital Logic and first Embedded Systems
                    class, I bought an FPGA board to design my own digital design modules in Verilog, to create my own
                    UART module to send data through a serial cable from my computer to the FPGA board. While I was able
                    to expand on my classes with personal projects, I also learned a lot through the clubs I was
                    involved in at Iowa State also. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;On campus, I was involved with two very technical clubs in the college of Engineering at Iowa State,
                    including Critical Tinkers, which I joined my Freshman year, and Solar Car, which I joined my
                    Sophomore year. In Critical Tinkers, I was able to get projects funded and parts provided as long as
                    I could prove I had a solid design and plan to complete it. One project I worked on with the help of
                    Critical Tinkers, with a partner, was to create a fully autonomous robot arm that would flip a
                    switch off after I turned it on. To do this, me and my partner designed an enclosure for the robot,
                    3D printed parts to make up the robot arm, and a PCB to interface with the Arduino microcontroller.
                    This project was extremely satisfying to complete, and I was very grateful to receive the support I
                    did from Critical Tinkers for funding to complete it. I also worked on multiple projects relating to
                    board design and system integration in the Solar Car club, mainly spending time my Sophomore and
                    Junior years with the team. During this time, I worked on developing hardware to interface with the
                    system of the solar car, including the lights, driver controls, and battery protection system.
                    During this time, I was able to draw the schematic of a board, do the layout, solder the board, test
                    it, and perform verifications when the new hardware was in the solar car. This sort of end to end
                    development was extremely beneficial to me, and it was an amazing experience to share with other
                    groupmates. Both of these clubs helped me learn how to work with and lead a team of engineers, who
                    all come from different specializations and backgrounds. During my time on these clubs, I was able
                    to learn a lot about managing a project and helping students stay involved over the course of a
                    semester. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;One of the most important things that I have learned at Iowa State is how to be a leader and an
                    engineer at the same time. Before I came to college, I held some different leadership positions in
                    activities I was involved in for High School, such as band, but I learned that it is somewhat
                    different for engineering. During my time on projects in Critical Tinkers and Solar Car, I had to
                    learn how to effectively convey information in a way that anyone could understand. Since my peers
                    were coming from a wide range of hardware and software backgrounds, I made a very strong point that
                    no matter what you knew before beginning a project with me, there is always room to learn more.
                    Alongside being a leader in clubs, I also enjoyed my time leading labs as a teaching assistant for
                    my Digital Logic and Embedded Systems 1 class. During both of these classes, I helped guide multiple
                    labs of 20 students each on performing their weekly lab material. During this time, I worked very
                    hard to teach students on how to properly debug code that doesn’t work, and how we determined that
                    that process would be effective. It was very gratifying to see my students, grow over the course of
                    a semester, and it made the job worth it every week. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;At Iowa State University, I learned a lot about becoming an engineer who can solve problems
                    effectively and think critically, but I also became a much stronger leader through the clubs and
                    classes I taught in. I have seen an amazing return on investment based on all of the time, work, and
                    planning that I have put into college, and I would not change much if I could choose to start over
                    again. I think that my time at Iowa State has set me up amazingly well looking towards graduation
                    and starting full time employment. <br> <br>

                    General Education Reflection
                </Header>

                <General>
                    In the past few years, I have taken multiple courses to complete my general education credits that
                    have helped me think more about social, global, and economic issues in our world today, and how
                    those could be applied to real world engineering problems. Throughout my time at Iowa State, I took
                    the classes History of the American City and Greek Civilization, while transferring credit for my AP
                    World History class from High School. In each of these classes, I learned about a broader scope of
                    issues than what may be covered in the technical portions of my engineering classes, to help round
                    out my education. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;The first general education course I got credit for was actually completed in High School, being my
                    AP World History class. During my time taking the course, we would have open discussions talking
                    about the different political, economic, and technological effects of major world events occurring.
                    We learned about how different countries or political powers grew over time and what led to such a
                    rapid growth over early human civilization. I thought this was very interesting, since it helped
                    teach me about why some outcomes may have happened like they did, since it was my job to come up
                    with some deductive reasoning, which translated really well into my engineering classes after High
                    School. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;The next class I took was History of the American City, where I learned about the development and
                    design of cities and parks from the colonial period, all the way up to the modern day. This class
                    was especially interesting, because similar to World History, it showed me how certain aspects of
                    our culture changed over time, and what the impacts to those choices could have been. For the final
                    essay in the class, I chose to write about the history of segregation in Washington D.C., which
                    enabled me to think critically about current societal issues and how those have evolved throughout
                    the last few centuries. History of the American City also taught me how to view the technological
                    development of a city in another lens, outside of the purely technical view an engineer may have.
                    After taking this class, I feel like I have a much more open approach to thinking about design
                    practices and how they can change over time. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;The final general education course that I took was Greek Civilization, where I learned about the
                    history of Ancient Greece from the Bronze Age to the Hellenistic period. We focused on the writings
                    of Herodotus and Thucydides, which led to multiple open discussions on how we interpreted their
                    stories, and how they could have contributed to the history of Greek culture. It was very fun to try
                    and interpret the meaning and significance of different passages from texts that were written in an
                    ancient period of Greece. I think that also had many applications towards Engineering today, in the
                    sense of making use of the information that you are given, even if it is not fully complete.
                    Overall, these general education classes helped to round me out over my four years studying
                    Electrical Engineering at Iowa State University. After taking closes such as World History, History
                    of the American City, and Greek Civilization, I think that I am a much more rounded out student. I
                    noticed a trend of taking all history classes, which I think shows that I want to learn more of our
                    past and analyze it, so that we can better understand why we do things the way we do in the modern
                    age. <br> <br>

                    Ethics Essay
                </Header>

                <general>
                    By following a code of ethics, it gives me a standard that I can always hold myself to. Without
                    this, it would be easier for me to bend rules and ethics if I didn’t have a standard to compare
                    issues with when they arise. By following a code of ethics, you also help to enable the people
                    around you to follow a similar code. While some of their ethics and principles may vary, there is
                    lots of value in discussing and establishing a code of ethics.
                    When I am faced when an ethical situation, the first thing I normally do is assess the problem and
                    who is involved. By asking myself questions related to these two factors, I normally am able to come
                    to a steady decision. For example, in the workplace with an ethical issue, there may be someone more
                    capable of handling the issue or giving me advice, like a mentor or boss I work for. Instead of
                    jumping to a conclusion quickly, I think there is a lot of benefit from stopping to ask basic
                    questions like this. For the specific problem, this can vary more case to case. When considering how
                    to handle ethical issues normally I fall back on my code of ethics and what I have learned in past
                    experiences. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;In class, we covered multiple ethical issues and held discussions on how they should be handled. One
                    issue that I looked into for these discussions was an ethical problem surrounding the Amazon Echo
                    and other smart home devices. This issue surrounded an accusation of a murder, where the police
                    wanted to take evidence from the Amazon Echo based off of when music was playing in the house. Based
                    on what time the music started, the police could counter the defendants claims on when he was at the
                    house of the murder. Amazon declined to give up this information, so the police ended up turning to
                    other smart home devices to find activity in the house. Another issue we discussed was surrounding
                    Volkswagen’s fake emission tests. Volkswagen uploaded software to over 10 million cars to fake
                    having a lower emission output than they actually had for their vehicles. This caused damage both to
                    the environment and ended up giving people headaches due to the large output. Volkswagen ended up
                    feigning ignorant and instead pushed the blame on to the factory workers. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;Overall, most of the class had similar opinions on both of the ethical problems I was discussing.
                    For the Amazon Echo issue, I believed that surrounding a murder trial, Amazon should have handed
                    over the sensitive data if it meant protecting more lives by putting a wanted man in jail. I noted
                    that it was hard to find where that line would be to start handing over data when requested, which
                    was my main dilemma. Some classmates argued that to stay from this point and protect users to not
                    hand over data at all. This would have been okay for the case since they found the data anyways
                    through another device. This was one of the more divided issues that I saw covered. The Volkswagen
                    problem was easier to agree upon though, since most classmates agreed Volkswagen was at fault. I
                    proposed to fix this solution they could add stricter emission tests and watch out for these faults
                    in the future. Still though, Volkswagen should have admitted faulty and been honest upfront, since
                    there are large consequences to their actions. The other replies I read to this issue also agreed,
                    since the factory workers were not to blame. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;Based on the virtue of ethics we discussed in class, I think that the three most related to the
                    Amazon Echo case were integrity, responsibility, and honesty. I believe that each of these virtues
                    tie very closely to the sensitive subject of a murder trial and ethics. Both the police and Amazon
                    have responsibility and integrity that they should follow to help deliver the guilty a sentence. I
                    think that this is easier for the police to follow since they were already doing their job, so I
                    think Amazon struggled to hold this up on their end. If they wanted to truly be honest and have
                    integrity, I believe they would have released the users Amazon Echo data to be used as evidence in
                    the case. While charity and fidelity help with holding up morals on something basic to follow like
                    avoiding murder, I don’t think this issue of ethics is about that. Instead, I think it is focused on
                    how smart devices can affect ethics and the situations that surround them. So, that is why I picked
                    the three initial virtues of ethics that I did. I can not think of any other virtues that would
                    apply to this case. This is mainly because the initial three encompass all of the values that I
                    thought about when handling this issue. <br> <br>
