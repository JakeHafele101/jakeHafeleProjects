                The main goal of this project was to create a PCB that would light up an Iowa State University logo with LEDs. I wanted
                to also design a box and glass cover over the circuit board. Since I was using a PCB, I wanted to try and design a 
                circuit without using an Arduino microcontroller and instead apply some of what I learned through my digital logic class
                that I took in the Fall semester. To do this, I would use a oscillator to act as a clock and a counter to activate the 
                transistors that would light up the yellow LEDs. I also would like to further learn how to use Alitum, which is the 
                PCB design software I used to design my board.

                With this project, I wanted to create something that would push what I have done so far with electronics design while 
                also making something fun. For this, I decided to make a useless machine. The sole job of this robot was to flip off
                any switch that I pressed down or turned on with the box. The robot arm is an improved version of my robot from 
                the motion controlled arm, which was a big challenge for this project. Overall, it is a very interesting build and 
                was tons of fun to make.
