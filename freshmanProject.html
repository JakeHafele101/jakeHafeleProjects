                <General>
                    Welcome anyone and everyone to my project portfolio website! I have been continuously updating this
                    website for over three years as I have been working through my undergraduate program at Iowa State
                    University. This portfolio holds information on everything I have done while studying Electrical
                    Engineering, including my projects, work experience, and an updated resume! Alongside all of the
                    projects I have worked on, I have had a lot of fun recording videos going over each project on
                    editing them, which I think is much more accessible for someone who is interested in my work or what
                    I do. If you are looking to get in contact with me to talk about a potential job or project I worked
                    on, the best page to visit would be the Resume page, which includes my email and LinkedIn account.
                    You can also find my LinkedIn and YouTube links at the Footer of this page.

                </Header>

                <General>
                    Currently, I am in my Senior year studying Electrical Engineering at Iowa State University. In the
                    past year, I completed a study abroad trip to Ireland and a co-op at Collins Aerospace, working as a
                    systems engineer intern on the CH-47F Chinook program. Over my time in College, I have been involved
                    in many clubs, including PrISUm Solar Car, Critical Tinkers, and the ISU Marching Band. These clubs
                    have given me so many amazing opportunities to meet great friends and work on multiple challenging
                    projects. I also enjoy creating my own YouTube videos, most recently including a GoPro for things
                    such as Hiking.
