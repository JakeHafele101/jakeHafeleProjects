                    This project describes my process in recreating one of the most iconic video games ever made,
                    Tetris! I specifically wanted to use class inheritance to reinforce what I learned in my java coding
                    classes in school. To do this, I planned on making a general class for the blocks and a specific
                    class for each individual block. I wanted the controls to be done through keyboard inputs by the
                    player, and a start, pause, and game over screen to make the game more accessible. To be more
                    faithful towards Tetris, a score, level, and lines cleared tab will be needed on the sides of the
                    main grid. The game will also display a next block and held block feature. These will be used to
                    give the player some help with the game. Finally, I wish to make the resolution a moderate to small
                    size so that the game could be more accessible. This project will be done in Processing, which is a
                    Java tool that helps to make drawing shapes and objects much easier. <br> <br>

                <General>
                    The first hardware project I ever created was a 4 x 4 x 4 LED cube. For this project, my main goal
                    was to get more familiar with soldering electronic part, to be interfaced with an Arduino Uno
                    microcontroller. I had never soldered before this, so I assumed that this would be the most
                    challenging part of the build for me. I would have to solder together every LED and resistor, then
                    wire them all back to the Arduino board to send different signals for the patterns. To do this, I
                    would need to create a template to create one layer of the cube. After all the layers would be
                    built, I would have to solder them together and wire it up to a perf board to make a more permanent
                    and final structure. At each point, I would need to check to make sure each LED could light up after
                    soldering the layers together with 5 volt and ground pins. After that, wires and resistors would be
                    added to the board and the Arduino uno would be placed on the permanent. After that, I could use
                    some test code I found online to test my cube and then create my own fun patterns. <br> <br>

                    For this project, I created an LED array based on multiple rows of LED strips, that would react to a
                    sound detection module attached to an Arduino Uno. The goal of this project was to get more
                    comfortable using LED strips and an input sensor to process data. I ended up using a sound sensor
                    for my input, since I could have the LED strips respond and light up to the music. I also used my
                    Ender 3 Pro 3D printer to design the structure to support all of the electronics. Most of the
                    circuitry will be done on a breadboard, with the tabs of the LED strips being soldered to wires,
                    then going to the breadboard circuit. I also planned to make the design of the box practical enough
                    to make the project easier to integrate. <br> <br>

                <General>
                    For this project I designed a robot arm that mirrored the movements of my hand while wearing a
                    glove. I wanted to gain a better understanding of using multiple analog inputs to control servos,
                    and I thought an application of a robot arm would be interesting, combined with my 3D printing
                    skills. These sensors would include a flex (resistive band) and motion sensor (MPU6050). The robot
                    arm would be controlled by servos at four different joints, to mimic the movements of a real arm. A
                    glove with both the flex and motion sensor were made to control the robot, with wires attached to
                    them with enough length to allow full range of motion. <br> <br>

                <General>
                    In this project, I used an Arduino Nano microcontroller, servos, and wireless transceivers to create
                    a small robot spider. This would be done by designing multiple parts of legs to connect to servos,
                    that would act as joints. I also needed to design a base that connected the four individual legs and
                    hold the Arduino and other electronics. I used a servo driver to control the individual legs with
                    Arduino code and a servo driver library. I also designed a controller on a breadboard that would be
                    used with wireless transceivers between the controller and spider. Two separate power supplies were
                    needed on the spider, to power the Arduino and servos separately. I created the spider be able to
                    move forwards, move backwards, turn left, and turn right. The controller had a total of 8 buttons,
                    allowing me to program some other fun actions, like waving or doing a pushup! <br> <br>
