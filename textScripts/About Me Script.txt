This year, I will be working on my third year towards a computer engineering degree at Iowa State University. 
I am involved in a few different clubs at Iowa State, including solar car, critical tinkers, and TEAM.
All of these clubs give me a great opportunity to make strong connections with other students and build upon what 
I have learned in my classes. Solar car especially has helped me learn more about board design and hardware 
ahead of some of the classes for my major. I also enjoy scuba diving, working on projects, and spending time with my dogs.
In my down time I like to work on making youtube videos for my side projects, which are seen on this very website!
Video editing is something I have increasingly become more interested in, because I think it is a really good way 
of showing off myself and my own ideas. 

Fun facts about me:

Favorite Movie: Whiplash
Favorite Video Game: Portal 2
Favorite TV show from last year: Invincible
Favorite Music Genre: Alternative Rock
Place I want to travel to: Ireland (Travel abroad!!)
A dog I want: A corgi
