Hello to anyone and everyone who has stumbled upon my website! This is a place all about yours truly, Jake Hafele. On here I mainly
post projects I make, but also have links to my social media accounts, youtube videos, and some other fun things like 3D printing. 
This acts as a hub to all of the content and stuff I like to show off, which can also be seen through my youtube videos (Link below
in footer) or in my github repositories (button below this paragraph). This is the second iteration of my html portfolio, with the 
first one being done back in May of 2020. As I have finished my second year of college, I figured it would be a great time to clean
up my website and make it even easier for people to enjoy my content. Feel free to click on the content tabs above this paragraph
to see some other general information about me, or click on the page headers at the top to see different projects I have created so 
far. Hope you enjoy your stay!
