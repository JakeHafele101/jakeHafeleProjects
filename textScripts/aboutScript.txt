Me in general

To start, I am a 19 year old college student who is now between thier first and second year of college. 
I enjoy building computers, scuba diving, and of course, writing code. I have had almost 10 different saint
bernards at different times growing up, so pets have also been a big part of my life growing up. I have grown 
up in the same small town in Illinois for most of my life, but now go to college at Iowa State University.
I am a huge fan of the larger college as it has helped me meet a lot of new people and gain new opportunities.



Classes at College

Currently, I am working on getting a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering at Iowa State university. I
decided on this major spur of the moment last Summer around July. I was planning on doing Electrical Engineering,
which is pretty similar, but I decided I wanted to focus on coding a little more. After finishing my first
year of college, I can say I am very happy to have made this choice. I mainly have an interest in coding 
related to hardware topics, but many different software areas have piqued my interest lately. I plan on 
trying out a bunch of different areas to find out what I like the most, to try and help me find what kind
of job I want after college. Right now, I am very interested in pursuing embedded systems.
