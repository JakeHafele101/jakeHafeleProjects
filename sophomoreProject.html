                    The main goal of this project was to create a PCB that would light up an Iowa State University logo with LEDs. I wanted
                        to also design a box and glass cover over the circuit board. Since I was using a PCB, I wanted to try and design a 
                        circuit without using an Arduino microcontroller and instead apply some of what I learned through my digital logic class
                        that I took in the Fall semester. To do this, I would use a oscillator to act as a clock and a counter to activate the 
                        transistors that would light up the yellow LEDs. I also would like to further learn how to use Alitum, which is the 
                        PCB design software I used to design my board. <br> <br>

                    With this project, I wanted to create something that would push what I have done so far with electronics design while 
                        also making something fun. For this, I decided to make a useless machine. The sole job of this robot was to flip off
                        any switch that I pressed down or turned on with the box. The robot arm is an improved version of my robot from 
                        the motion controlled arm, which was a big challenge for this project. Overall, it is a very interesting build and 
                        was tons of fun to make. <br> <br>

                    The primary goal of buttonboard is to take driver inputs on the steering wheel and convert them to signals that can control the varying lights
                        and horn of the solar car. As per regulations needed for the vehicle, it was required that the driver select these buttons without taking their
                        hands off the wheel and that they will be able to control them. Some buttons will be latching to represent turn signal indicators, while other
                        buttons will be nonlatching, like the horn. Buttonboard is represented as an "application" PCB in the solar car that is used to help manage
                        driver interaction with the car off of the 12V Main power line from the battery pack, which is turned on only after the battery protection
                        system connects the positive and negative relays to the battery pack. <br> <br>

                </Header>

                <General>
                    Headnode is one of two different custom PCB's in solar car that are apart of our Battery Protection System 
                        (BPS). The two boards included are Moduleboard, which monitors the status of a battery module, which includes
                        34 18650GA Lithium Ion batteries in parallel. Our entire battery pack includes 35 of these battery modules in 
                        series to reach a nominal voltage of 140 V. Headnode, on the other hand, controls the battery pack relays by 
                        checking if either the hardware or software faults on either board are triggered. Both the hardware checks made 
                        by comparators and the software checks made against a voltage reference need to not be triggered on a moduleboard. 
                        The hardware fault is ANDed with the logic check from the next board, so when one module faults in the middle 
                        of the board, the proceeding moduleboards will also fault. The initial 5V "Working" signal for the fault is 
                        initially supplied by Headnode, and sent to Moduleboard #1. At the last Moduleboard, #35, this ANDed logic 
                        signal will be sent back in to Headnode as an input. The software checks are made over an isolated CAN network 
                        that is connected only to the boards inside the battery pack. <br> <br>
                        
                        Generally, the purpose of BPS is to monitor these faults and control the battery pack relays that open/close to 
                        control battery consumption. Both BPS and Powerboard, a board used to regulate the battery pack voltage down to 
                        12 V, are powered off of a 25 V supplemental battery used to check the state of the batteries before drawing 
                        current from them. This is needed as a safety precaution and because of regulations we have to follow to build 
                        the car. With this supplemental battery, BPS will check to see if any hardware and software faults trigger in 
                        the car, and if they don't, BPS will close the positive, negative, and charge relays in the battery pack. After 
                        this is done, Headnode will send a buffered 12V logic signal to powerboard indicating that it is now okay to 
                        draw current from the battery pack through the closed relays. Powerboard will simultaneously switch off of 
                        drawing power from the supplemental battery pack to our main battery pack. After this, the fourth and final 
                        board in the battery pack, Precharge, is powered and can start to slowly increase the voltage given to the 
                        motors through a power resistor. Since we use DC series motors, if we instantly give it 140 V through a closed 
                        relay, we would blow them up. <br> <br>
                        
                        Generally, this lays out how our newly revised battery pack architecture works. Before this revision of Headnode, 
                        Precharge was used to drive 12 V through the positive and negative relays that connect to the battery pack 
                        terminals. So, the primary goal of this rev was to maintain satisfying regulations to turning on the 
                        car and moving relay logic from Precharge to Headnode.  <br> <br>

                    The link to this tab goes over what I learned during my first year on the PrISUm solar car team at Iowa State University. 
                    Some of the things included are learning board design, working on the car over Summer 2021, and working with as a leader on 
                    the electrical team. During the first year on the team, I worked on the hardware prokects for Buttonboard, which takes inputs 
                    from the driver to control different lights and horn in the car. I also joined the battery protection team in the Spring, 
                    teaching me about different ways to monitor Lithium-Ion battery voltage, current, and temperature with different hardware 
                    and software implementations. I also learned a lot about system level testing over the Summer 2021 period, 
                    where I learned how to integrate the boards I designed into the solar car and test them in a real world application, 
                    by driving the solar car on the road. Finally, I joined the electrical leadership team in Solar Car by becoming the 
                    first Librarian, meaning I would manage all of our Git repositories and parts that we use to build our hardware. <br> <br>

                <General>
                    In the middle of June I ended up getting my first 3D printer. The printer I ended up buying was Creality's Ender 3 Pro. 
                        From what I looked up, the ender 3 pro offered great detail and print quality for entry level printers. It came with all
                        of the tools I needed to set it up and some white PLA filament. After this ran out, I bought a 1 kg spool of black PLA 
                        filament to fuel my first large project. I designed a box that will be printed with this printer later for my led strip
                        project. More information will be posted about that soon in another tab on my site later. The idea of this page is to 
                        share pictures of my more detailed or fun prints and also post my issues and solutions with the printer. Since 3D printing
                        is so complex, there are many issues that come up over time. As I use the printer more, I hope to document these problems
                        and my process in how I handled them. This could be helpful for any other new printers or people who are just curious about
                        how the printer runs. The dimensions of the ender 3 pro are around 8 x 8 x 9 inches, which allows me to print basically anything
                        I wish. I am looking forward to showing this thing off throughout the Summer! <br> <br>
