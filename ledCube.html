                    My Goals
                </Header>

                <General>
                    The first hardware project I ever created was a 4 x 4 x 4 LED cube. For this project, my main goal
                    was to get more familiar with soldering electronic part, to be interfaced with an Arduino Uno
                    microcontroller. I had never soldered before this, so I assumed that this would be the most
                    challenging part of the build for me. I would have to solder together every LED and resistor, then
                    wire them all back to the Arduino board to send different signals for the patterns. To do this, I
                    would need to create a template to create one layer of the cube. After all the layers would be
                    built, I would have to solder them together and wire it up to a perf board to make a more permanent
                    and final structure. At each point, I would need to check to make sure each LED could light up after
                    soldering the layers together with 5 volt and ground pins. After that, wires and resistors would be
                    added to the board and the Arduino uno would be placed on the permanent. After that, I could use
                    some test code I found online to test my cube and then create my own fun patterns.

                    The Process
                </Header>

                <General>
                    One challenge that I didn't consider until doing a hardware project like this was finding a proper
                    setup and the right tools. It took me a decent sum of time to find the right tools from our garage
                    and the right materials to make my project go as easy as possible. After enough searching, I found a
                    drill and some small bits that would equip me to create a cardboard template to make each layer of
                    the LED cube. Although, there were many things I had to order online that I didn't have readily
                    available. The most important tool to order was my first soldering kit. I also got an almost
                    excessive number of LEDs, resistors, and wires to help me with both current and future projects.
                    After I set everything up in my kitchen, I was ready to go. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;My first goal was to figure out an efficient process for making a 4 x 4 layer of LEDs. With the
                    guide I followed, it recommended bending the cathodes of the LEDs down to be parallel with the
                    cardboard template I designed. This made it so the overall cube would have the ground signals being
                    controlled by the specific layer it was on, and the anodes be soldered together vertically between
                    each layer. This technique is known as multiplexing, which makes it so I only would need 20
                    different pins to control each LED individually from my Arduino Uno, instead of 64. The positive LED
                    ends would end up going through the holes of the final perf board, while the 4 ground wires would
                    come out of the side of the cube. I ended up soldering the negative legs of the LEDs together in 4
                    rows for the layers, and soldered two wires on the ends of the layers to help connect the ground
                    signal between each of the rows. This also helped in giving the cube more support for each layer.
                    After I was successfully done with creating one layer, I created three more in the same way. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;Now that I had four identical layers built, the next step was to solder the positive legs together
                    to stack the layers on top of each other. To help do this, I cut out two small cardboard strips that
                    would be used to prop up the layer when there were not many joints connected yet. Crocodile clips
                    also helped with this, as I would clip the three corners while I soldered the first leg of one of
                    the corners between the layers. I worked my way from the outside in, starting with each of the four
                    corners. I found that this was the best way to build overall support for the cube, which made it
                    easier to solder the inside joints. Once I had all four layers attached, I went over every layer
                    with solder to ensure each ground signal had a solid connection to every LED. After that was
                    confirmed, I moved on to the permanent setup. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;My final product was based around building the cube on a perf board, as mentioned before. The first
                    thing I did was get an adhesive pad, and I placed it between the Arduino Uno and the board to mount
                    the Arduino on to one half of the board. After that, I placed 16 resistors for the LEDs right by the
                    Arduino Uno, so the wires could come out closer to the Arduino. This made cable management much
                    easier, and also made it so wires would not get in the way of the final lightshow. After this, I
                    used crocodile clips and tweezers from my soldering kit to push the 16 positive LED legs through the
                    prototype board. Once this was done, I soldered 4 wires, one going to each layer, that would end up
                    connecting to the Arduino to control the ground signals. After that, I soldered the positive LED
                    legs to the resistors on the backside of the prototype board. At this point, everything was soldered
                    and set. At this point I loaded up preset code to test my cube to make sure it was running properly.
                    After that, I created my own patterns using this code as a template to run my cube. <br> <br>

                <General>
                    Overall, this project ended up being more challenging than I expected, and in different ways than my
                    other coding projects. I didn't expect the soldering to be as time consuming or difficult as it was,
                    but that was because I was still a beginner with it at the time. Although, I did learn a lot about
                    soldering and many helpful tricks through trial and error. At the time, this was my first exposure
                    to directly working with electronics and hands on circuits, which definitely boosted my interest in
                    electrical engineering as a whole. I think it is really satisfying to create tangible designs like
                    this LED cube to interact with the real world. I hope I can write more of my own code from scratch
                    in the future, to help further solidify using hardware and code together to make this projects
                    function correctly. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;Note from 2023: After editing this page, I got a wave of nostalgia from when I was working on this
                    during COVID-19. I had a great time teaching myself about circuits and soldering, and this project
                    definitely attributed to a lot of my motivation for the rest of the projects on my portfolio. Thanks
                    again for reading! <br> <br>
