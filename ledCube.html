                    <General>
                        The goal of the last two week for me has been to create a 4 x 4 x 4 LED cube. For this project, my main goal was to get 
                        more familiar with soldering electronic parts to be used with arduino boards.I had never soldered before so I figured 
                        that this would be the most challenging part of this build for me. I would have to solder together every LED, resistor, 
                        and wire all to connect back to the arduino board to send different signals for the pattern. To do this, I would need to
                        create a template to create one layer of the cube. After all the layers would be built, I would have to solder them 
                        together and wire it up to a board to make a more permanent and final structure. At every point, I would need to check
                        to make sure each LED could light up after soldering the layers together with 5 volt and ground pins. After that, wires
                        and resistors would be added to the board and the arduino uno would be placed on the permanent. After that, I could use 
                        some test code I found online to test my cube and then create my own fun patterns.

                        more familiar with soldering electronic parts to be used with arduino boards.I had never soldered before so I figured

                        some test code I found online to test my cube and then create my own fun patterns. <br> <br>

                        One challenge that I didn't consider until doing a hardware project like this was finding a proper set up and the right
                        tools. It took me a little bit to find the right tools from our garage and the right materials to make my project go as
                        easy as possible. But, eventually, I found a drill and small enough drill bit that would work, alongside some cardboard. 
                        Although, there were many things I had to order online that I didn't have readily available. The biggest thing was ordering
                        a soldering kit. This was essential for the job. I also got an almost excessive amount of LEDs, resistors, and wires to 
                        help me with the current and future projects. After I set everything up in my kitchen, I was ready to go. <br> <br>
        
                        My first goal was to figure out an efficient process for making a 4 x 4 layer of LEDs. With the guide I followed, it 
                        reccomended bending the cathodes, or negative legs, of the LEDs down to be parallel with the template I made. This made
                        it so the overall cube would have the ground signals being controlled by the specific layer it was on, and the anodes, 
                        or the positive legs, be soldered together vertically between each layer. This technique is known as multiplexing, which
                        makes it so I only would need 20 different pins to control each LED individually from my arduino uno, instead of 64. The
                        positive LEDs would end up going through the holes of the final prototype board, while the 4 ground wires would come out
                        of the side of the cube. I ended up soldering the negative legs of the LEDs together in 4 rows for the layers, and soldered
                        two wires on the ends of the layers to help connect the ground signal between each of the rows. This also helped in giving
                        the cube more support for each layer. After I was successfully done with creating one layer, I created three more in the 
                        same way. <br> <br>
        
                        Now that I had four identical layers built, the next step was to solder the positive legs, or anodes, together to stack
                        the layers on top of each other. To help do this, I cut out two little cardboard strips that would be used to prop up the
                        layer when not many joints were soldered on yet. Crocodile clips also helped with this, as I would clip the three corners 
                        while I soldered the first leg of one of the corners between the layers. I worked my way from the outside in, starting 
                        with each of the four corners. This was the best way to build overall support for the cube, which made it easier to solder
                        the inside joints. Once I had all four layers attached, I went over every layer to make sure each ground signal was being
                        reached by every LED, to make sure my soldering was still holding up. After that was good, I moved on to the permanent 
                        setup. <br> <br>
        
                        My final product was based around building the cube on a prototype board. A prototype board is a board that has tons of 
                        tiny holes for wires to go through, which makes wire management and soldering much easier for projects like this. The 
                        first thing I did was get an adhesive pad and stuck it between the arduino uno and the prototype board to mount the 
                        arduino on to one half of the board. After that, I placed 16 resistors for the LEDs right by the arduino uno's side of 
                        the board, so the wires would come out closer to the arduino. This made cable management much easier and made it so wires
                        would not get in the way of the flashing cube once it was finished. After this, I used crocodile clips and tweezers from
                        my soldering kit to push the 16 positive LED legs through the prototype board. Once this was done, I soldered 4 wires, 
                        one going to each layer, that would end up connecting to the arduino to control the ground signals. After this, I soldered
                        the positive LED legs to the resistors on the backside of the prototype board. At this point, everything is soldered and
                        set. At this point I loaded up preset code to test my cube to make sure it was running properly. After that, I created
                        my own patterns using this code as a template to run my cube. <br> <br>

                        Overall, this project ended up being more challenging than I expected in different ways than my other coding projects.
                        I didn't expect the soldering to be as time consuming as it was, but that was definitely because I am still a beginner
                        with it. Although, I did learn a lot about soldering and many helpful tricks through trial and error. I also am excited
                        to do more hardware projects like this in the future. I think it is really fun to create tangible things like this LED 
                        cube to make it light and and make fun patterns. I hope I can write more of my own code from scratch in the future to
                        help further solidify using hardware and code together to make this projects function correctly. I plan on making something
                        with LED strips next with 3D printing, and I am planning on writing all of my code from scratch for that to learn more about
                        that.
