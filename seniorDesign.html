                <General>
                    During the Spring 2023 Semester, I began my senior design project at Iowa State University. Senior
                    Design is a two semester course, with a focus on research and design in the first semester, and then
                    implementation in the second semester. The project that me and three other group mates are working
                    on is called Digital ASIC Fabrication, and will involve designing and fabricating a digital ASIC.
                    Our client and advisor will be Dr. Duwe, a professor at Iowa State who researches and teaches about
                    computer architecture and cyber security topics. Dr. Duwe has had two previous senior design groups
                    follow the same process and design cycle as we will, each staggered one semester apart. The first
                    senior design team was able to successfully get their chip approved and fabricated, and we are
                    currently waiting to receive it. If all goes well, part of our second semester goal will include
                    bringing up the first chip developed by an earlier team. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    Since we started a few weeks ago, we still do not currently have our project selected. We will be
                    submitting our open-source project through Efabless, which is an ongoing project working towards
                    standardizing ASIC production and open-source tooling. There are many helpful links, documents, and
                    a slack channel full of resources for us to use, alongside the previous senior design team who is in
                    their second semester currently. By submitting our project through Efabless, we will be able to
                    perform the logic design, waveform testing, and hardening of a silicon chip, all in one project. I
                    am extremely excited to see this project from start to end, and am looking forward to narrowing down
                    our projects and beginning our planning phase. <br> <br>
