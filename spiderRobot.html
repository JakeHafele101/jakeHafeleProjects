                The main goal of this project was to create a robot that would act like a spider. This would be done by creating 
                different parts of legs to connect to servos, that would act as joints. I would also need to design a base that could
                connect the four seperate legs and hold the arduino and other electronics. I would use a servo driver to control the 
                seperate legs with arduino code and a servo driver library. I will also design a controller that will be used with
                wireless receivers between the controller and spider. Two seperate power supplies will be needed on the spider to power
                the arduino nano and the servos seperately. I planned on making the spider be able to move forwards and backwards, while
                also being able to turn left and right. I also added more buttons on the controller to make the spider be able to do
                other fun actions.

            <div class="contentMain">
                At the start of this project, my main focus was trying to design how the different joints would connect to the servos.
                I ended up doing this by cutting out space for the horns to fit in on the joints so the servos could screw in to them
                from one end. The other end had holes that would slot in to cylinders to keep the joint in place on the sides that 
                didn't have the servos attached. This made for a very consistent way to connect the joints of the legs for the spider.
                I started with using three servos and joints for the spider, but later reduced it to two due to the servos not being 
                able to support the whole spider when it was put together. I also made the base much smaller than my first design. After
                the spider was getting designed, I worked on a CAD model for the wireless controller. This was a fairly simple design,
                but the cover took a little bit more time since I added some text and pictures on it. As all of these parts were being
                printed and tested, I was also working on the code that would make these parts move. <br><br>

                I made many different programs for this project. Many of them are test programs that I use to demo and try out the new
                electronics that I bought to work with Arduino. I first made a test send and recieve code to test out the wireless
                receivers. This acted as a call and response and you set it so one side sends the data, while the other takes the data 
                from the sender. It was hard to tell when the code was the issue or the wires, but once it was working, it functioned 
                just like I needed it to. I also found a library and coded how the servo driver would work with the servos on the legs.
                This was pretty straightforward once I found a good library to use with the servo driver. I then started working on 
                the code for the wireless controller. This would send the number of which button was being pressed only once to the 
                receiving side, so I could use a switch case and change the movements of the spider when that was ready. This code was
                fairly short and easy to read, and I was really happy with how it turned out. <br><br>

                Once all my parts were shipped and printed, it was time to put together the spider. I attached the legs to the servos 
                when they were positioned at 90 degrees, so I could move them both left and right 90 degrees. I then soldered the
                arduino nano, wireless receiver, and wires to the servo driver to the prototype board. After this was done, I mounted
                the prototype board to the base of the spider after placing the battery packs on the base. As you can see in the videos,
                the prototype board sits right on top of the batteries compactly. Once everything was put together, I started coding the
                movement for the spider. I wrote many helper functions to make this easier for me. While this took a bit of time, it made
                me visualize the movement of the spider much easier. This was the last part of my project and by this point I was very
                happy with how the spider turned out. This design for the legs could be applied to spiders with more legs or other 
                sensors, which could be useful for the future. <br><br>

                To conclude, I am really happy with how this project turned out. There was a lot of time spent on redesigning the spider
                and trying to minimize the size of it, but it was worth it in the end. I feel a lot more confident in using servos after
                this project and whenever I use them again I think it will be a lot easier. I plan on still doing projects once the school
                year starts, but they will probably not be done as often. Either way, thank you for checking out my last project of the 
                Summer! It was a really fun project to work on for a couple weeks before school starts again!
