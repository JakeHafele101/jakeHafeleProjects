                    Embedded Systems 1 Teaching Assistant - Iowa State University <br> <br>

                <General>

                    As my second time as a teaching assistant, I chose to help teach Embedded Systems 1, which I took as
                    a class in the Spring semester of my Sophomore year. During this class, students are exposed to
                    their first steps to embedded programming in C, done on the application of a Roomba cleaning robot.
                    On top of the robot is a development board with an ARM microcontroller, LCD display breakout, and
                    Wi-Fi UART module, enabling the students to simulate a Mars space mission as a final project. Each
                    week, we cover something new such as outputting data to the LCD display over UART, controlling the
                    movement and sensors of the Roomba, or filtering data from an IR sensor. Since I took this class
                    online during Covid-19 in my sophomore year, it has been very satisfying and engaging to help teach
                    students how to move and control the robots in person.

                    Fluids and Heat Transfer Lab Technician - Iowa State University <br> <br>

                <General>

                    Between being a teaching assistant for my Embedded Systems 1 and Digital Logic class, I worked as a
                    lab technician for the Fluids and Heat Transfer labs in the Mechanical Engineering department. The
                    reason for this was because I was allowed to work more than 10 hours and could do more hands on work
                    with the students during the lab times. While there was a dedicated Graduate TA working with me in
                    the lab, it was my job to help students more with interfacing the lab equipment and how to receive
                    effective data. In the Heat Transfer labs, students were expected to collect data with LabVIEW
                    programs or a FLIR camera to measure the heat dissipation of several different metals and objects.
                    In the Fluids labs, students were expected to measure the flow rates of different pipe systems as
                    different conditions were altered.

                        <li>Collaborated with coworkers to set up upcoming labs and material </li>
                        <li>Supported students by verifying measured data points and regression models

                    Digital Logic Teaching Asssistant - Iowa State University <br> <br>

                <general>

                    In my sophomore year, during the Spring semester, I had the opportunity to become a teaching
                    assistant for the first time. I was very excited to teach Digital Logic, since I took the class the
                    previous semester and really enjoyed the “building block” aspect of digital design. During my time
                    as a teaching assistant, I would help students to design combinational logic, sequential logic, and
                    state machines over the course of the semester. It was very satisfying to see the students grow and
                    learn, and slowly increase the rate at which they could develop more and more complex systems. This
                    job helped to show me how much I enjoyed working with HDL and what possibilities could be open to me
                    down the line further on.

                    <h4>Tasks Performed</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Engaged with students to teach introductory digital design circuits
                        </li>
                        <li>Prepared 2 weekly recitations and labs each week for 20 students </li>
                        <li>Held 1 office hour each week to help guide students through labs
                        </li>
                        <li>Proctored 3 exams online with 60+ students throughout the semester</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Skills/Tools Developed</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simulated digital circuits with Quartus Prime and Modelsim </li>
                        <li>Developed HDL code in Verilog</li>
                        <li>Helped students debug digital design modules from examining waveforms </li>
                        <li>Reviewed old material and assignments to create effective learning strategies through
