                The main goal of this project was to get more comfortable with using LED strips and an input sensor to change the strips.
                I ended up using a sound sensor for my input, since I could have the LED strips respond and light up to the sounds. I 
                also wanted to use my new 3D printer to design and print off the structure to support all of the electronics. I will
                solder and connect the wires with a breadboard and arduino uno. I also wanted to make the design of the box practical
                enough to make the project easier on me.

                Process

            <div class="contentMain">
                Out of all the projects I have done this Summer, this one is probably the one that took the most planning and development
                from the beginning. Once I figured out some planning and design details, the project went along a lot smoother. For 
                example, since this was my first time using a CAD modeling software, that took longer than expected. I went through
                two different iterations of my 3D print through this project. I made the print much more condensed and smaller with the
                second version so it would print easier. I ended up importing CAD models of my arduino, breadboard, and other parts to 
                make sure the dimensions were accurate. I also had some trouble with using the sound sensor, since I could never get the
                analog input just right. The analog input would return a voltage between 0 and 1023 based on loud the surroundings were.
                Since this didnt work out well, I ended up using the digital pin to sense whether sound was being detected in an on or 
                off state. After putting the right resistor into the sound sensor to decrease the gain, this worked out well for me. The
                last part of prep for this project was testing and using the LED strips. The FastLED library made this go a lot easier 
                than I thought, and I am really happy with how the LEDs display. Once the individual parts were all ready, it was time
                to connect everything. <br><br>

                While my 3D print was still going on, I soldered the pin headers for the sound sensor on. Once the print was done, 
                I started to move parts onto the build. I used adhesive pads to place the arduino and sound sensor on it. The breadboard
                already had adhesive on it, so I just used that. I connected the ground, 5V, and digital pins from the sound sensor to 
                the arduino first. This was because there was less wires than the LED strips and it would be easier to get these plugged 
                in first. I then cut up the LED strips to have 10 LEDs each and soldered 3 8 inch jumper wires to the ends of them. These
                signals would give the power, ground, and digital to the arduino. I used craft wire to bundle up each trio of wires for 
                the strips to try and keep the back more organized. I would thread the wires through the opening on the 3D print and 
                test the LED strip before sticking it on the front. This was so I could resolder them easier if needed. All of them ended
                up working without having to be soldered again which was very nice. I also set a capacitor on the breadboard to try and 
                help reduce flickering from the LED strips. By this point, everything was hooked up correctly, and it was time to code 
                these parts together. <br><br>

                Like I said before, I used the FastLED arduino library to help me use my LED Strips. For each pin used, I would define
                what pin number it was in at the top of my code. I would also define things like how many strips I used, and how many
                LEDs were on each strip. I also had to specific the brightness, color order, and type of LED strip to set it up correctly
                with FastLED. FastLED has a function to add LEDs by defining the type, pin, and color order. I also had to use a function
                named setBrightness with the brightness constant. After this I had to set a pinMode up for the digital pin so that the 
                input could be read during the loop of the code. This was all done in the setup() function for arduino, which runs once, 
                similar to the first part of processing. In the loop, I first initialized an integer called gate that would read the 
                input of my digital pin on the sound sensor. This would return a 1 or 0 depending on if sound was being picked up or not. 
                I then added an integer called hue that would constantly switch through the values of 0 and 254 to change the colors of
                the reacted LEDs. I also added an if check so I could modify how fast the change in hues was over time. I then added some
                if else statements to check when the gate value was 1 or 0. If sound was detected, the LED strips would increase the amount
                of changing colors by 2 for every strip. If sound wasn't detected, the LED strips would decrease the changing colors by 
                one. I added two functions at the bottom of my code to help me display the LEDs. setWhite() was made to make all of the 
                LED strips white, acting as a background. Then, I made the other function called setRainbowWithWhite(). This would call
                setWhite() from within it and then write over that by defining a set amount of LEDs to make the rainbow colors. I had an
                array called rainbowNum to keep track of how many LEDs in each strip should be one of the changing colors at any given time.
                At the bottom of my main loop, I added the line FastLED.show(), which would display every LED that I set up at the start 
                of my code. This wrapped most of my code for the sound responsive LED strips, but I plan on making more patterns for this 
                project in the future, since it allows for a lot to be done with the LED strips. <br><br>

                This project helped me get more used to a lot of different things. For one, this helped me get my feet wet with CAD modeling
                and 3D printing. This will be a huge help for projects going forward and I can tell I have already learned a lot through
                working with it in the past few weeks. I also enjoyed being able to work with an input/output system through using the
                sound sensor to affect the LED Strips. This has helped me learn of good ways to test the different parts of my project 
                before putting it all together, which is something new to me. The LED strips have got me hooked on using them, so I am
                sure that I will find ways to stick them in other projects when I have a chance. it is easier to use strips that are
                connected instead of being split up, since you need less wires and soldering. I plan on adding more patterns to this project
                since I have a 9 X 10 set of LEDs at my disposal now. I am planning on working on designing some type of car for my next
                project so I hope to have that stuff up on here soon too. Thanks for reading!
