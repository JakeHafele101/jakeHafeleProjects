                <General>
                    The last time I had written any Verilog was when I worked as a Digital Logic Teaching Assistant back
                    in the Spring 2021 semester of school. Since then, I have done a lot of work on Iowa State’s solar
                    car team, PrISUm, learning many skills related to PCB design and system wide testing. As I look
                    ahead towards getting my Masters at Iowa State, I have thought about learning more about FPGA’s
                    since I enjoyed my time in Digital Logic learning about combinational logic, sequential logic, and
                    state machines. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    To get myself more familiar with the basics of digital design and Verilog, I decided to buy the
                    Basys 3 Artix 7 FPGA development board sold by Diligent. This board comes with a 100 MHz clock, 16
                    switches, 16 LED’s, 5 buttons, a USB Host, UART Bridge, VGA output, and seven segment displays.
                    Between all of these features, I figured that I would be able to apply what I have learned in my
                    digital logic class and go beyond it to more topics based on my personal interests and future
                    classes. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    On this specific page, both videos cover demos and conversation about my time working with designing
                    modules and testbenches related to combination logic, sequential logic, finite state machines, UART
                    communication, and PS2 keyboard receiving interfaces. As a guide, I have been following through the
                    first 9 chapters of the textbook “FPGA Prototyping by Verilog Examples” by Pong P. Chu. This book
                    has helped expand on the syntax that is both synthesizable and not for Verilog, while also
                    explaining useful design practices. I have found this extremely beneficial for modules involving
                    UART, PS2 communication, and complex state machines. Normally in each chapter, the concepts and
                    basic outline of a module will be defined, with extra experiments added at the bottom to expand upon
                    what is given. Through my work over two months, the code presented in these demos are from those
                    experiments. If you are interested in the modules and testbenches I have designed, feel free to
                    access my GitHub repository below! <br> <br>

                <General>
                    During the Spring 2023 Semester, I began my senior design project at Iowa State University. Senior
                    Design is a two-semester course, with a focus on research and planning in the first semester, and
                    then design and implementation in the second semester. The project that I chose to join with three
                    other group members was Digital ASIC Fabrication, which involves designing and fabricating a digital
                    ASIC. Our client and advisor are Dr. Duwe, a professor at Iowa State who researches and teaches
                    about computer architecture and cyber security topics. Dr. Duwe has had two previous senior design
                    groups follow the same process and design cycle as we are, each staggered one semester apart. The
                    first senior design team was able to successfully get their chip approved and fabricated, and we are
                    currently waiting to receive it. For our project, our requirements are to design a digital ASIC chip
                    using Verilog and open-source tools, alongside developing firmware and a bring-up plan to assist a
                    future team in verifying the functional requirements of our design. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    We are able to create our digital ASIC by working through the company eFabless, which is sponsored
                    by Google. The goal of eFabless is to use open-source tools that are freely available to silicon
                    prove both digital and analog ASICs for hobbyists, researchers, and students, who do not have a
                    large pool of resources to take advantage of. Being a senior design team, this was an excellent
                    opportunity to learn more about writing Verilog, using new open-source tools, and designing a chip
                    for fabrication that would come back on an SOC development board. All of the submitted designs are
                    required to be open-source, with the benefit of receiving 5 ASICs that are placed on a development
                    board. eFabless produces their silicon wafers through the U.S. based foundry SkyWater, which takes
                    advantage of 130 nm technology and a standard cell library to fabricate our project. Due to this, we
                    are limited to this fabrication process and the standard cell library that is provided by SkyWater
                    in their 130 nm product development kit. Each project submission is produced on a wafer that houses
                    open-source designs from multiple different projects, enabling eFabless to produce small amounts of
                    ASICs for each team at a reduced cost. While working with open-source tools and a limited production
                    cycle has been difficult through eFabless, they are in a very unique and rare position by offering
                    free digital ASIC fabrication, that is returned on an integrated development SOC board for us to
                    test. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    As of now, the first semester of senior design has been completed. During this time, we were able to
                    determine our design plan with doctor Duwe, research more about the tools we will be using, and
                    begin testing submodules in our design. Our team decided on a modular design with multiple different
                    functions, including a clock gating module, digital signals processing filter, an external SPI
                    interface, and more. The intent of choosing a modular design was to push the capabilities of the
                    fabrication process at the SkyWater foundry, and see how many working pieces we could receive on our
                    digital ASIC through working with eFabless. <br> <br>
