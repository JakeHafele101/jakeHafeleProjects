                <General>
                    The last time I had written any Verilog was when I worked as a Digital Logic Teaching Assistant back
                    in the Spring 2021 semester of school. Since then, I have done a lot of work on Iowa State’s solar
                    car team, PrISUm, learning many skills related to PCB design and system wide testing. As I look
                    ahead towards getting my Masters at Iowa State, I have thought about learning more about FPGA’s
                    since I enjoyed my time in Digital Logic learning about combinational logic, sequential logic, and
                    state machines. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    To get myself more familiar with the basics of digital design and Verilog, I decided to buy the
                    Basys 3 Artix 7 FPGA development board sold by Diligent. This board comes with a 100 MHz clock, 16
                    switches, 16 LED’s, 5 buttons, a USB Host, UART Bridge, VGA output, and seven segment displays.
                    Between all of these features, I figured that I would be able to apply what I have learned in my
                    digital logic class and go beyond it to more topics based on my personal interests and future
                    classes. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    On this specific page, both videos cover demos and conversation about my time working with designing
                    modules and testbenches related to combination logic, sequential logic, finite state machines, UART
                    communication, and PS2 keyboard receiving interfaces. As a guide, I have been following through the
                    first 9 chapters of the textbook “FPGA Prototyping by Verilog Examples” by Pong P. Chu. This book
                    has helped expand on the syntax that is both synthesizable and not for Verilog, while also
                    explaining useful design practices. I have found this extremely beneficial for modules involving
                    UART, PS2 communication, and complex state machines. Normally in each chapter, the concepts and
                    basic outline of a module will be defined, with extra experiments added at the bottom to expand upon
                    what is given. Through my work over two months, the code presented in these demos are from those
                    experiments. If you are interested in the modules and testbenches I have designed, feel free to
                    access my GitHub repository below! <br> <br>
