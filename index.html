                </Header>

                <General>
                    Welcome anyone and everyone to my project portfolio website! I have been continuously updating this
                    website for over three years as I have been working through my undergraduate program at Iowa State
                    University. This portfolio holds information on everything I have done while studying Electrical
                    Engineering, including my projects, work experience, and an updated resume! Alongside all of the
                    projects I have worked on, I have had a lot of fun recording videos going over each project on
                    editing them, which I think is much more accessible for someone who is interested in my work or what
                    I do. If you are looking to get in contact with me to talk about a potential job or project I worked
                    on, the best page to visit would be the Resume page, which includes my email and LinkedIn account.
                    You can also find my LinkedIn and YouTube links at the Footer of this page. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    Long term, I would like to become specialized in some type of field with a Graduate degree, right
                    now leaning towards something related to PCB design, FPGAs, or possibly something related to digital
                    signals processing or radio frequency devices. I hope to gain a better understanding in each of
                    these fields as I complete my last year of my Undergraduate degree and my Masters at Iowa State
                    University. After graduation, I am planning to stay within the Midwest so that I can be closer to
                    family. I am looking forward to entering industry to apply the skills I have learned in my classes,
                    projects, and internships towards something that can help improve the lives of people daily.

                <h4>Featured Projects</h4>

                <General>
                    Below is a list of some of my favorite and most interesting projects to this day! I think all of
                    these projects show how much I have grown as an engineer in school, and what I have to look forward
                    to in my future classes, projects, and career in general. If you are interested in some embedded or
                    3D printing work, I would suggest you take a look at my Freshman year projects. If you would like to
                    learn more
                    about my time on Solar Car, or how I started my journey with PCB design, then I would suggest
                    reading
                    up on my Sophomore and Junior year projects page. As of my senior year, I have been working on a lot
                    of FPGA projects both on my own and in school, so the Senior year page would be great for that. Hope
                    you enjoy! <br> <br>

                </Header>

                <General>
                    Currently, I am in my Senior year studying Electrical Engineering at Iowa State University. In the
                    past year, I completed a study abroad trip to Ireland and a co-op at Collins Aerospace, working as a
                    systems engineer intern on the CH-47F Chinook program. Over my time in College, I have been involved
                    in many clubs, including PrISUm Solar Car, Critical Tinkers, and the ISU Marching Band. These clubs
                    have given me so many amazing opportunities to meet great friends and work on multiple challenging
                    projects. I also enjoy creating my own YouTube videos, most recently including a GoPro for things
                    such as Hiking. If you would like to see some of these GoPro videos, check out the tab to the right
                    of this one!

                    GoPro Videos
                </Header>

                <General>
                    During the Summer of 2023, I decided to buy a GoPro while I was on Co-op at Collins Aerospace. While
                    I
                    have not gone to too many adventurous places yet, I have really enjoyed editing together videos of
                    me
                    spending time with my friends. I think that capturing both the technical and fun parts of my college
                    career has been very rewarding, and it goes to show how much I have grown throughout my time at Iowa
                    State. If you care to see some of the videos I've made, check them out below!
