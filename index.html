                    Hello to anyone and everyone who has stumbled upon my website! This is a place all about yours truly, Jake Hafele. On here I mainly
                    post projects I make, but also have links to my social media accounts, youtube videos, and some other fun things like 3D printing. 
                    This acts as a hub to all of the content and stuff I like to show off, which can also be seen through my youtube videos (Link below
                    in footer) or in my github repositories (button below this paragraph). This is the second iteration of my html portfolio, with the 
                    first one being done back in May of 2020. As I have finished my second year of college, I figured it would be a great time to clean
                    up my website and make it even easier for people to enjoy my content. Feel free to click on the content tabs above this paragraph
                    to see some other general information about me, or click on the page headers at the top to see different projects I have created so 
                    far. Hope you enjoy your stay!

                    <General>
                        This year, I will be working on my third year towards a computer engineering degree at Iowa State University. 
                        I am involved in a few different clubs at Iowa State, including solar car, critical tinkers, and TEAM.
                        All of these clubs give me a great opportunity to make strong connections with other students and build upon what 
                        I have learned in my classes. Solar car especially has helped me learn more about board design and hardware 
                        ahead of some of the classes for my major. I also enjoy scuba diving, working on projects, and spending time with my dogs.
                        In my down time I like to work on making youtube videos for my side projects, which are seen on this very website!
                        Video editing is something I have increasingly become more interested in, because I think it is a really good way 
                        of showing off myself and my own ideas. 
                        <br> <br>
