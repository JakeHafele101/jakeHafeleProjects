            Hello to anyone and everyone who has stumbled across my website! This is my first time working with 
            Javascript and HTML and I am excited to get my first website up and running. I have lots of ideas and
            plans for future projects and hope to keep them all organized on this website in the future. I plan on
            having a youtube video going over the project and what I learned throughout the process of creating different
            things. These will all be posted on my youtube channel and embedded in this very here website too. I also
            have a page about me and another for my contact information for anyone interested. At the ends of every page
            I also am planning on posting a github link to each seperate repository of code. This is done so people can
            understand my projects and take a look into my process of coding as a college student. I'm sure I could be doing
            a lot of stuff better or more efficiently but I am having a lot of fun learning and doing my own stuff along
            the way. If any of this sounds interesting, please check out my other tabs of stuff!
