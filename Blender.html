                    <General>
                        Blender is something I have been interested in for a while since I have gotten into 3D modeling. Before this, my only experience 
                        modeling was with Fusion 360 to help design and 3D print parts for my projects. I wanted to get into a different type of modeling,
                        that would help me design more detailed 3D prints or renders that were just pretty to look at. I always feel like I have a lot of 
                        different ideas for how I want projects or things to look like, and I think Blender will give me a great opportunity at showing
                        other people what I want to create. <br><br>

                        So far, I have been mainly relying on online sources like youtube to help me create and render models in blender. There are plenty
                        of great online tutorials on Youtube including Blender Guru's tutorial on how to make a coffee and doughnut. I have also been keeping
                        a small notebook to jot down some small "hacks" or tricks that I learn along the way, just to make things easier to reference once 
                        I can stand on my own two feet with the software. I hope that I keep working on blender to find my niche in some fun things that I want
                        to create. Right now I have been bouncing between many different techniques and features just to get an understanding of everything that
                        the program has to offer. More to come soon!

                        Since I am just starting out, I figured now might be better than ever to list out some things I want to create in the future. I think
                        making a cartoony style of every day objects come to life would be very fun. I also would like to create a "miniature world" that
                        holds a small chunk of some type of enviornment or scene in a bubble. Both of these ideas sound really interesting and there are tons
                        of different directions I could take them. <br><br>

                        Future project ideas:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Miniature worlds</li>
                            <li>Cartoony objects</li>
                            <li>Video game objects</li>
                            <li>Animation with rain</li>
                            <li>Natural enviornment with woods or desert</li>
                            <li>Things to 3D print with cool geometry</li>
                        </ul>
