            </div>
            <div class="contentMain">
                In the middle of June I ended up getting my first 3D printer. The printer I ended up buying was Creality's Ender 3 Pro. 
                From what I looked up, the ender 3 pro offered great detail and print quality for entry level printers. It came with all
                of the tools I needed to set it up and some white PLA filament. After this ran out, I bought a 1 kg spool of black PLA 
                filament to fuel my first large project. I designed a box that will be printed with this printer later for my led strip
                project. More information will be posted about that soon in another tab on my site later. The idea of this page is to 
                share pictures of my more detailed or fun prints and also post my issues and solutions with the printer. Since 3D printing
                is so complex, there are many issues that come up over time. As I use the printer more, I hope to document these problems
                and my process in how I handled them. This could be helpful for any other new printers or people who are just curious about
                how the printer runs. The dimensions of the ender 3 pro are around 8 x 8 x 9 inches, which allows me to print basically anything
                I wish. I am looking forward to showing this thing off throughout the Summer!<br><br>

                Leveling The Bed
            </div>
            <div class="contentMain">
                Leveling the bed is something that is crucial for any 3D printer. The bed refers to the plate that the nozzles pushes out the hot 
                plastic filament onto during the prints. There are four large gears under the bed that are used to raise or lower that respective
                corner of the bed. The best way I have found to level the bed is to place a piece of paper between the bed and the extruder nozzle.
                If the paper can not go between them, the bed must be lowered so it can. If it is too loose, the bed must be raised enough. After 
                leveling one corner, I go to the opposite back corner and work my way around to the other two corners after that. If the bed is too
                low, the filament could dry before it reaches the bed, which can lead to your print not sticking and messing up during the middle of
                the print. If the bed is too close to the nozzle, the extruder will not be able to push out the right amount of plastic and it will 
                become stuck to the printing bed. Luckily, the ender 3 pro uses a magnetic bed so you can take off the magnetic sheets and replace them
                easily if it gets damaged. Leveling the bed is generally simple, since you have to lower the z axis of the printer to the bottom and check
                the corners, but I have learned that it is very important for a successful print. <br><br>
