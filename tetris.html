                The goal of this project was to make the most faithful recreation of an old style tetris game. I 
                specifically wanted to use class inheritance to reinforce what I learned in my java coding class at school. 
                To do this, I planned on making a general class for the blocks and a specific one for each block. I wanted
                the controls to be done through keyboard input by the player. I also wanted a start, pause, and game over
                screen to make the game more accessible for the user. To be more faithful towards tetris, a score, level, 
                and lines cleared tabs will be needed on the sides of the main grid. The game will also display a next block
                feature and a held block feature. These will be used to give the player some help with the game. 
                finally, I wished to make the resolution a moderate to small size so the game could be more accessible. 
                This project will be done in Processing, which is a Java tool that helps to make drawing shapes and 
                objects much easier. Currently, this is my go to application for making simple games. <br> <br>

                To keep track of everything in this project, I made a google slides list to document the differnet stages
                of my project. To see more of this directly, you can scroll down to my YouTube video below. What I talk 
                about here will be an overview of that but more condensed. The first thing I did was draw out on my computer
                how I wished for the game to look to the user. To achieve this, I made my first class, the Menu class. This
                class would handle showing most of the games elements, except for the cells. It would display and keep track
                of the strings and integers for the lines cleared, score, and level values. I ended up settling on a dark
                gray theme for the general User Interface, since this would help make the actual tetris blocks stand out 
                more. <br> <br>

                To make a usable grid for the actual tetris blocks, I ended up making a Cell and Grid class. The cell class
                would keep track of the variables of each block on the grid. The Grid class would then take an x and y 
                parameter in its constructor to make a 2d array of Cells. This helped model my layout of cells, since I could
                access this 2d array object inside of the grid class and use certain x and y indexes to manipulate the cells.
                The cells were not constructed anywhere but inside of the grid class. After the grid class was cosntructed
                inside of the main program in setup(), it would loop to be shown to the UI inside of draw(). To specify,
                the setup() function is always ran once, while the draw() function loops infinitely unless directly stopped.
                This is helpful, since you can initiate objects once inside of setup() then show them and modify them in 
                draw() for however long you need. <br> <br>

                Now that a grid and cells are made, I could start making the Block class and the specific tetris blocks. 
                Each tetris block class inherits the block class and passes their color into their constructors. The 
                specific blocks are named after the letter they represent by their shape, like T or I. After succeeding in
                getting each block to be constructed and placed at the top of the grid, I worked on figuring out how to 
                make the blocks fall and rotate. To do this, the Block class had methods to detect if there were 'solid'
                cells around the 'active' cells. The solid cells were the borders and placed tetris pieces, while the active
                cells were the current tetris block. This ended up making my code more complicated by the end of the project,
                but the final product still works well with it. A spawn zone was also added at the top of the grid, and is
                hidden from the player, so the blocks spawn right above the active grid. User input was also added at this
                stage with Processing's keyPressed() and keyReleased() functions. These helped to make it so you could get 
                multiple inputs at once, instead of using their 'key' keyword. <br> <br>

                Now that the blocks could be manipulated, I needed to add conditional checks to make the lines and score
                update when blocks were placed. I used two for loops to go through the grid array to check if all horizontal
                blocks in a row were solid. If so, another grid method would be called to clear that specific row, while also
                moving every row above it down one y position. This made it so the line would go away while also updating
                the other remaining solid cells. This is when I also implemented updating the score, lines, and level values
                inside of menu, since they could now also be properly updated. For every ten lines, the level goes up one 
                number. Every level, the speed of the game gets faster, so the amount of frames before the block drops gets
                lower. The score will increase based on your level and how many lines you clear at once. The next block and
                held block features were also implemented now. They would construct a new 4x2 grid each to display the 
                blocks for their respective purposes. Hidden integer values were kept to keep track of these blocks outside
                of the grid. A helper function was defined inside of main to help randomly calculate the next block and 
                swap the current and held block. <br> <br>

                The final features that I added to this game was the different game states and menus that came with them. 
                These would include the start, pause, and game over screens. I made a switch case statement in the draw()
                loop in my main program and a integer variable called gameState to keep track of the current state. Constants
                were defined for the different states and user input or conditions would be used to swap them. The different
                states would be placed into their own methods to make readability higher for the switch case. This is why
                the main draw() loop is so short. Most of the games functionality comes from the statePlaying() helper function
                in Tetris.pde.  <br> <br>

                Since I also made a game in processing during the school year for a project, I really enjoyed tackling 
                another project after learning some things from my firt game. I felt more confident in designing menus and
                manipulating objects than I did in my first game. Using inheritance for the tetris blocks also helped me reinforce
                what I was learning in my java class at the time around finals. Although, I did come across a few issues 
                with this project. My cell class ended up being more lengthy and complicated than I wished for, and it made
                manipulating every other method much harder than it had to be. If I was going to start again, I would have 
                made the grid out of integer values in a 2d array instead of cell objects. This is because integers are primitive
                and it is easier to change them since they do not point to objects like the Cell class did. This made moving
                and swapping the cells much more complicated than it had to be. Although, this did teach me to really think
                through how making early classes can impact the rest of a project, especially core files like Cell or Grid. 
                Once I got so far in the project, I couldn't really change anything in these classes since they were used so
                much. I would like to remake this game at some point after planning out how to set up the whole project
                up with pseudocode. Overall, this was a great project that helped reinforce my java and coding skills. I 
                am happy to say that this is my first project posted on my website so I hope you enjoyed it! If you want to
                play my game, you can download the files on github and open them with the processing java application. I am
                currently trying to embed the game in to my website, but I am having more troubles with that than expected.
                Thanks for reading!
