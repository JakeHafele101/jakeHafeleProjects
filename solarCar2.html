                    <General>
                        As mentioned on the other pages, I managed the hardware projects for both the horn and lights PCB, HAL, and
                        our battery protection system, BPS. HAL was designated as a new member project, where I worked with 2 new 
                        electrical engineers to iteratively design and update the board based off of design issues from the previous 
                        year. This was a fantastic opportunity to help new college students learn more about PCB design and electrical
                        engineering as they are working through the intro classes like calculus and physics. I also enjoyed being in a 
                        mentor position to help them if they ever had any general questions on the team. If you would like to learn 
                        more about the technical changes with HAL please take a look at it's individual page on this site. <br><br>
                        
                        When managing BPS, I was in charge of creating a new revision for Headnode and maintaining the Moduleboard 
                        project. Both of these boards are essential for running our car and maintaining the safety of our driver and
                        passenger, so I took a great role of responsibility with this job. Since the board is more technical, we did
                        not have any new members on this project with me so I assumed both a leadership and technical role with BPS. 
                        This meant that I would conduct design changes on headnode while also advising how we should address upcoming
                        issues as the hardware leader for this project. If you would like to learn more about the technical side of
                        BPS, please look into my Headnode Rev 1 or Headnode Rev 2 pages.

                    FSGP/ASC 2022
                    </Header>
    
                    <General>
                        For solar car, there are two different types of races that you can participate in. Every year, FSGP, or the
                        formula sun grand prix, is hosted. FSGP consists of a track race and also doubles as a qualifying event for
                        the second race, ASC. To race at FSGP, we have to go through multiple scrutineering panels with officials to 
                        prove our car meets regulations surrounding topics like our battery protection system, driver egress, and 
                        dynamics driving. This year, I was one of four drivers that participated in both races. This meant I was very
                        involved in the scrutineering and admission process before our first race started. I had to get a ballast bag
                        so that my overall seat weight was 180 pounds, had to practice egressing out of the car under a set amount of
                        time, and also had to pass multiple dynamics tests performing slalom and figure eight maneuvers around cones. 
                        The scrutineering process overall took 3 days, which involved lots of preparation on the car both mechanically
                        and electrically. After we passed everything though on the third day, we were ready to go out to the track race.<br><br>
                        
                        The track race was in Topeka, Kansas at the Heartland Motorsports Park. Similar to scrutineering, the track 
                        event lasted three days. To qualify as a team to proceed to the next race, our team had to either finish 80 
                        laps in one day, or 120 laps across two days. As a driver, I had to personally drive at least 21 laps so that
                        I could drive in the next race. On the first day, our first driver accured around 25 laps before we were facing
                        our first car troubles. This was a suspected issue for a while with our electrical system, so we took the car
                        out of the hot pit to fix it for around 2 hours. After that time, we were back on the track with a couple of 
                        hours left in the day. I was neither a driver or passenger the first day, but our second driver was able to 
                        get around 15 laps towards her personal qualification. We ended up only getting around 40 laps on our first day,
                        so we broke even for the two day qualification. The next day, I was able to be our first driver. In one burst
                        without any breaks, I was able to complete 25 laps in the morning and qualify as a driver. After that, we 
                        rotated in the two other drivers to get their personal laps and qualify. By this time, we had around 50 laps
                        completed, and were getting close to hitting the 80 lap qualify goal. While things weren't very exciting during
                        this time, that was a good thing, since it meant the car was working as expected. As the day ended, we racked
                        up 90 laps. Last year at the track event, we were only able to complete 20 laps for the entire three days, so
                        our team was very happy about this. For the third day, we completed another 80 laps and had a similar process
                        of switching out drivers every 1 to 2 hours. <br><br>
                        
                        ASC stands for the American Solar Challenge, and this is the more traditional racing style that you might see
                        from a solar car competition. Instead of racing on a track with only solar cars, you race across the oregon 
                        trail to see how efficient and far your team can get with solar power. Since we qualified this year, we were 
                        able to start the race with other teams in Independence, Missouri. After driving nearly 20 miles, we were facing
                        serious motor controller issues that led us unable to drive any further outside of Independence. We did stay to 
                        reach the first checkpoint to discuss our options with race officials and other teams, but had no luck. Motors 
                        and motor controllers are a gray area for the team, and we did not want to risk anyones safety, so we decided 
                        to call the second race there. It was still a great experience to be a part of the caravan process and be a 
                        driver during this time though. <br><br>

                    <General>
                        While most of my librarian work was done with creating our new parts catalogue system, I still did lots of 
                        Librarian work in the Fall of 2021 too. My main focus was creating a new standardized parts library for our 
                        boards to use, since a lot of the older boards use old parts that are not included in the shared list of today. 
                        The benefit of making a new library was that it was now trimmed down much more, making it easier to both 
                        organize the parts physically, and order them online since more boards would have a standardized resistor or
                        mosfet. I have heard that the library is a success from other hardware managers, especially when they need to
                        create a smaller board or project from this year, since it is much more straightforward in finding what you 
                        need. I am hoping other managers and projects will work to integrate this library in the future, but now they
                        atleast have the option to. <br><br>
                        
                        Another one of my jobs was to clean up and standardize our github repositories for our hardware projects. 
                        Since this was managed and organized person to person on each project, it was very difficult to find 
                        documentation, bill of materials, and the actual schematic of the PCB's at times. As you will see in the 
                        github links on my page, each repository is now organized at the root level with a folder for a BOM, project, 
                        documentation, and gerber file. While this may have seemed redundant at the start of the Fall, this made it 
                        incredibly easy to organize documentation or part orders for the 2022 races that I previously mentioned. This 
                        was something I personally struggled to find across our different PCB's the previous race cycle, so it was 
                        another one of my primary goals as I was exiting the librarian role.
