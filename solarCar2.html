                    Managing Hardware Projects
                </Header>

                <General>
                    As mentioned on the other pages, I managed the hardware projects for both the horn and lights PCB,
                    HAL, and our battery protection system, BPS. HAL was designated as a new member project, where I
                    worked with 2 new electrical engineers on the team to iteratively design and update the board based
                    off of design issues from the previous year. This was a fantastic opportunity to help new college
                    students learn more about PCB design and electrical engineering as they are working through
                    introductory classes like their first Circuits class. I also enjoyed being in a mentor position to
                    help them if they ever had any general questions on the team. If you would like to learn more about
                    the technical changes with HAL, please take a look at its individual page on my portfolio. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    When managing BPS, I was in charge of creating a new revision for Headnode and maintaining the
                    Moduleboard project. Both of these boards are essential for running our car and maintaining the
                    safety of our driver and passenger, so I took a great role of responsibility with this job. Since
                    the board is more technical, we did not have any new members on this project with me so I assumed
                    both a leadership and technical role with BPS. This meant that I would conduct design changes on
                    Headnode while also advising how we should address upcoming issues as the hardware leader for this
                    project. If you would like to learn more about the technical side of BPS, please look into my
                    Headnode Rev 1 or Headnode Rev 2 pages.

                    FSGP/ASC 2022
                </Header>

                <General>
                    For solar car, there are two different types of races that you can participate in. Every year, the
                    formula sun grand prix, or FSGP, is hosted, while every other year the American Solar Challenge, or
                    ASC, occurs. FSGP consists of a track race which also doubles as a qualifying event for the second
                    race, ASC. To race at FSGP, we had to go through multiple scrutineering panels with officials to
                    prove our car meets regulations surrounding requirements including our battery protection system,
                    driver egress, and dynamic driving. This year, I was one of four drivers that participated in both
                    races. This meant I was very involved in the scrutineering and admission process before our first
                    race started. I had to get a ballast bag so that my overall seat weight was 180 pounds, practice
                    egressing out of the car under a set amount of time, and also pass multiple dynamics tests
                    performing slalom and figure eight maneuvers around cones. The scrutineering process took a total of
                    3 days, which involved lots of preparation on the car both mechanically and electrically. After we
                    passed everything on the third day, we were ready to go out to the race track. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    The track race was in Topeka, Kansas at the Heartland Motorsports Park. Similar to scrutineering,
                    the track event lasted three days. To qualify as a team to proceed to the next race, our team had to
                    finish 80 laps in one day, or 120 laps across two days. As a driver, I had to personally drive at
                    least 21 laps so that I could qualify and drive in the next race, ASC. On the first day, our first
                    driver accrued 25 laps before we were facing our first car troubles. This was a suspected issue for
                    a while with our electrical system, so we took the car out of the hot pit to fix it for around 2
                    hours. After that time, we were back on the track with a couple of hours left in the day. I was
                    neither a driver or passenger the first day, but our second driver was able to get around 15 laps
                    towards her personal qualification. We ended up only getting around 40 laps on our first day, so we
                    broke even for the two-day qualification. The next day, I was able to be our first driver. In one
                    burst without any breaks, I was able to complete 25 laps in the morning and qualify as a driver.
                    After that, we rotated in the two other drivers to get their personal laps and qualify. By this
                    time, we had around 50 laps completed, and were getting close to hitting the 80 laps to qualify.
                    While things weren't very exciting during this time, that was a good thing, since it meant the car
                    was working as expected. As the day ended, we racked up 90 laps. Last year at the track event, we
                    were only able to complete 20 laps for the entire three days, so our team was very happy about this.
                    For the third day, we completed another 80 laps and had a similar process of switching out drivers
                    every 1 to 2 hours. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    ASC stands for the American Solar Challenge, and is the more traditional racing style that you might
                    see from a solar car competition. Instead of racing on a track with only solar cars, you race across
                    the Oregon trail on real roads to see how efficient and far your team can get with solar power.
                    Since we qualified this year, we were able to start the race with other teams in Independence,
                    Missouri. After driving nearly 20 miles, we were facing serious motor controller issues that led us
                    unable to drive any further outside of Independence. We did stay to reach the first checkpoint to
                    discuss our options with race officials and other teams, but had no luck. Motors and motor
                    controllers are a gray area for the team, and we did not want to risk anyoneâ€™s safety, so we decided
                    to call the second race there. It was still a great experience to be a part of the caravan process
                    and be a driver during this time though.

                    Librarian
                </Header>

                <General>
                    While most of my librarian work was done with creating our new parts catalogue system, I still did
                    lots of Librarian work in the Fall of 2021 too. My main focus was creating a new standardized parts
                    library for our boards to use, since a lot of the older boards use old parts that are not included
                    in the shared list of today. The benefit of making a new library was that it was now trimmed down
                    much more, making it easier to both organize the parts physically, and order them online since more
                    boards would have a standardized resistor or MOSFET. I have heard that the library is a success from
                    other hardware managers, especially when they need to create a smaller board or project from this
                    year, since it is much more straightforward in finding what you need. I am hoping other managers and
                    projects will work to integrate this library in the future, but now they at least have the option
                    to. <br> <br>

                    &#8195;
                    Another one of my jobs was to clean up and standardize our GitHub repositories for our hardware
                    projects. Since this was managed and organized person to person on each project, it was very
                    difficult to find documentation, bill of materials, and the actual schematic of the PCBs at times.
                    As you will see in the GitHub links on my page, each repository is now organized at the root level
                    with a folder for a BOM, project, documentation, and Gerber file. While this may have seemed
                    redundant at the start of the Fall, this made it incredibly easy to organize documentation or part
                    orders for the 2022 races that I previously mentioned. This was something I personally struggled to
                    find across our different PCB's the previous race cycle, so it was another one of my primary goals
                    as I was exiting the librarian role.
